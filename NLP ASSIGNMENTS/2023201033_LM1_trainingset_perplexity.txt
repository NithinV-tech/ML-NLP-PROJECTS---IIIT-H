darcy: 20.56704777662166

mr: 1.1671869341936407

they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room: 10.699292081870958

<NUM> of la belle assemblee <NUM> st july 1815_ pride prejudice: 7.423497183793489

excuse my interference: 9.270856887477182

darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life: 8.199042838654178

could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected: 12.973414838341247

while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning: 7.7715544876565525

bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them: 8.393862005789394

it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be: 7.160843265438638

on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs: 7.929575275779633

i do not know: 6.977576727577978

i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company: 11.479625741122772

collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs: 6.522949700194101

mrs: 1.1671869341936407

jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention: 10.615997374254555

we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately: 7.840344246635549

philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr: 11.15434691212186

i hope they will not meet at all: 7.672337033913642

but here he was set right by mrs: 7.4197462393018085

she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved: 8.094772747401587

do you not know that such a report is spread abroad: 11.739219773439071

he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring: 13.56320339868815

let her be called down: 13.72376945918096

i see your design bingley said his friend: 8.922322030723825

oh: 5.194974020099931

lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter: 8.866219133523593

you may well warn me against such an evil: 14.039703743241915

insolent girl: 4.797141785693573

bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him: 6.936796945787997

with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal: 7.275684312311433

lady catherine seemed pleased: 17.17167265072682

her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous: 11.540765252465018

that is as it happens: 9.801164250753263

charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs: 11.51495582913175

he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter: 9.656318293048223

i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be: 6.943624715989167

i depend on you for that: 8.857384240900204

you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters: 7.353324635925634

let wickham be _your_ man: 5.948100745667533

what is his name: 47.25119340172709

you are rather disposed to call his interference officious: 5.912353130939031

dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed: 14.548172102903644

collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother: 7.894716170793116

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: 7.0690774972061

i have not the smallest hope: 4.788651268748248

she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe: 8.300468237655256

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr: 15.303485113007783

robinson did not i mention it to you: 5.850120731374722

and mrs: 2.8050788248485303

the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn: 6.478027502113908

the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin: 8.802384447011114

hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation: 8.56169131574777

had you then persuaded yourself that i should: 6.306297843100795

yes where else can they be so well concealed: 7.814413560849298

but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence: 6.720311442697802

of what are you thinking: 8.327346746251584

and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail: 17.457730230412892

i see no occasion for that: 34.38653218174255

bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again: 8.471353883091508

in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief: 12.3440549646524

when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel: 11.93403401566356

elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention: 8.202872160262226

darcy has no defect: 6.776846168774569

are quite well: 3.1049628279776655

they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea: 11.016546542028927

lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him: 8.398275519781127

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could: 9.695672785432027

but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead: 19.553041974197214

he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere: 8.082458634488374

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs: 7.9824660200723105

cried lydia: 12.769970556263651

forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness: 10.815586492607563

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first: 7.018519305553306

one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it: 8.989157576497835

collins all praise of me will be unnecessary: 7.096328700332724

never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting: 7.800768831440998

who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival: 9.200592675768837

darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning: 9.507103310128958

her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return: 7.86099776461758

it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers: 12.86698738608597

perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company: 7.079039664438552

bromley of course: 15.283387495873553

i ought not to have said a word about it: 15.704271814750392

you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing: 10.010598974157343

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt: 11.1894565813803

compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means: 6.482939982494991

but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging: 5.518216056349397

from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink: 5.922985404509369

how long has she been such a favourite: 10.358378131151136

this accounted to elizabeth for mr: 10.314527922806178

even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away: 13.5860845688784

hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves: 10.72808910573779

i am not one and twenty: 8.447595918706583

bingley and his sisters: 12.384205579257541

but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge: 7.263653013513888

elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly: 7.056660242660298

the suspicions which had just arisen of mr: 5.591897803883686

darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs: 11.49890890952208

but i must tell you how it went off: 19.256063378456666

but so they always are: 10.07335136444759

when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs: 9.416136396317679

the supposition did not pain her: 6.7506329035857044

their manners are not equal to his: 4.8929693707744635

bennet s being quite unable to sit alone: 7.1938003476058565

bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen: 14.574746296788804

darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear: 7.776788501775586

how would she have behaved: 12.304341530436195

through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance: 8.509429614135488

certainly not at first: 5.780852193572428

without a governess you must have been neglected: 5.4820989267385505

_too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject: 7.279563894095745

she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what: 9.558029696501203

the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it: 13.676545985260153

my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart: 9.462446987894905

yes sir but i do not know when _that_ will be: 11.905391492478545

it must be his own doing: 5.037059655312049

the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr: 9.011112423582148

charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley: 8.63416955544513

i do not at all know but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield: 7.789449954976073

jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians: 6.910845186101895

you do not know what i suffer: 20.00479040141291

in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well: 7.121714946804147

our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money: 7.538104317757515

having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy: 17.861563469540148

since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education: 10.564518336930126

gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror: 10.964345819816234

bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly: 8.510733789457948

the old lady is mrs: 6.725162796746272

and pray when am i to wish you joy: 14.9096986354409

elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter: 9.233459227759425

her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully: 11.84766600839182

darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small: 8.665466228971313

project gutenberg is a registered trademark: 16.306314468263867

and do you really know all this: 9.900317067294854

collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs: 9.853256359785357

it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s: 6.982246432588335

darcy s progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page: 8.943915587246668

well any friend of mr: 6.891651994905777

why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more: 23.426591262538885

but with _me_ it is not so: 21.854645655463898

hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room: 6.663664884435207

colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body: 9.364294053778583

i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her: 5.6343306787388014

in every view it is unaccountable: 23.593949052503344

i know it to be impossible: 12.548996853279982

bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for: 7.250823256537689

my object _then_ replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to: 9.85527728061586

she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended: 12.810277438761151

though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you: 6.531932589213988

it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement: 9.773858358133989

her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard: 8.498306684238432

i thank you for explaining it so fully: 11.382324689262912

darcy_ you see is the man: 5.345070213033555

he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him: 8.318502712042932

it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom: 7.343752955775892

i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary: 13.854154283537875

colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton: 9.242002798624155

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs: 11.248104734727923

a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme: 8.128912369039972

they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence: 15.832253987705435

but mr: 4.867334124467894

a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment: 8.3538381039797

how acutely did she now feel it: 7.3143848210758415

what is to become of us: 45.23301891791458

she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family: 8.833901384106554

by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself: 10.137768781159604

you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it: 10.409469258955442

darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment: 9.799679687083135

my uncle is to send a servant for us: 15.511434963159449

bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr: 12.725299544339798

but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most: 6.2620800531574545

allowing for the common demands of the game mr: 7.486346437248896

i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone: 8.848724337266775

he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam: 10.578917228664375

bingley was incomprehensible: 8.286011171084494

she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed: 9.42803838989209

he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton: 10.976361087558343

darcy give you his reasons for this interference: 6.789144814058221

were questions with which she amused herself: 14.887044027777904

she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her: 8.450029326395441

bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life: 8.384275172043719

i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing: 12.361937574929415

your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me: 10.509501408158803

bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them: 11.842838046227293

they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned: 9.912608681320286

and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road: 13.720339780884979

i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal: 10.713122987671046

the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other: 8.364417430192054

that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask: 8.446326524271463

darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh: 12.278043973556684

certainly he replied biting his lips: 4.196129416539329

he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners: 6.880314622543832

a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible: 8.74921225170767

lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her: 9.645270202073847

how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr: 6.793289300628218

the commendation bestowed on him by mrs: 5.460030942546763

for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions: 9.083714100183872

that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears: 9.014328461453466

i roused and interested you because i was so unlike _them_: 6.471601510983334

jane was by no means better: 12.204126350719346

if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better: 12.138534268586191

her ladyship was highly incensed: 17.27798275618682

cried elizabeth but how could _that_ be: 3.8276981951809694

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer: 22.213635130808207

darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration: 8.37796420391356

and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case: 9.790594377592058

no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation: 9.010449129446352

collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him: 6.61648069860092

louisa you will not mind my waking mr: 11.140831902488813

elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr: 7.750797722642466

i have a high respect for your nerves: 6.50728885221622

cried elizabeth when she had finished: 5.38820018317352

she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all: 10.278016266451676

jenkinson to make up her party: 9.408342286537366

every kind of pride must revolt from the connection: 6.634348367754619

no: 9.469401141361093

as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go: 8.923389753738316

caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time: 7.909082068635551

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations: 7.938328369327527

gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk: 11.086024421258713

but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham: 7.803527530999625

we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve: 6.465152000821991

bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them: 9.441195761192906

elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied: 8.733077868750858

he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me: 9.514515058014121

lizzy said her father i have given him my consent: 8.332574422667301

after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr: 7.8950683841815765

darcy is not to be laughed at: 5.4221809729060695

darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr: 7.996275387440731

lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her: 8.697257210046411

i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing: 6.621419695738096

he shook his head: 11.27757054483239

she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr: 8.406198988341426

he is his own master: 5.252323846608894

elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another: 7.831341761054232

<NUM>: 33.69656771922211

she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour: 13.096733287962318

from their infancy they have been intended for each other: 4.817762637736424

well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband: 11.388167384444229

his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative: 12.284842229546285

it must have been his sister s doing: 6.819671227965657

darcy had been at her sister s wedding: 11.869340197207421

you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth: 12.810399795532529

your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr: 13.952306569892137

bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord: 8.948905227408737

much as i respect them i believe i thought only of _you_: 8.339339917866088

bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr: 14.894439218265944

i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had: 18.662557942393892

bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs: 10.427747813766704

it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married: 13.9472108461674

i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been: 8.585848482002325

whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully: 6.696962307356391

to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr: 7.660655549437025

she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable: 7.038778880576934

neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance: 9.77740916855515

and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry: 9.254998780030954

london printed for t: 5.423343895167184

bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations: 6.92685240104631

the happiest wisest most reasonable end: 6.7506329035857044

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable: 10.12495419450797

collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family: 20.018486012918224

she was very equal therefore to address mr: 5.31909082959111

and so you like this man s sisters too do you: 8.520052368146981

you need not: 18.861366727739487

he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country: 9.28783133322238

the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough: 9.004098086500196

compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements: 6.550032201436912

collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr: 10.078707836977157

i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom: 6.0530571575090155

yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one: 8.40216287260698

she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever: 10.62491362387937

your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather: 8.970982969578904

jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening: 16.167078926498007

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured: 9.13803107075113

much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball: 8.51913253596801

this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it: 7.399342661874894

aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one: 7.496476093662889

is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman: 6.62407449844929

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr: 9.688877324167533

what sort of a girl is miss darcy: 32.322901847746124

i understand that mr: 5.3310736893310064

if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement: 9.041428435042521

she comes to us to day: 13.081431318132761

he wrote last week to hurry my return: 9.282476542884877

elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked: 5.917407401165087

elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr: 8.443649811716613

collins instead: 7.350719077955638

he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room: 6.929522856608978

i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her: 5.545231958208326

she liked him too little to care for his approbation: 6.403006901714102

long: 5.9024204049051034

but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs: 6.641294064795459

collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many: 6.721129801514803

i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago: 7.29105314875384

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room: 10.331857266199286

he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately: 7.164947373946646

kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill: 6.012884109317879

the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr: 7.42484120651105

well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home: 10.132374446852332

he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else: 14.497619633995605

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken: 8.29075892970889

i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers: 7.371411573429728

she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be: 14.663776213682672

i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away: 9.66901794229095

it is admirable: 5.676957168087144

the moral will be perfectly fair: 6.7506329035857044

she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas: 12.198233813352909

on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer: 10.77186583869373

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment: 12.431150623522269

in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy: 7.5120528644180995

it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr: 7.183262293254511

the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident: 18.95619232628263

i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before: 11.55091381867556

are not you curious to hear how it was managed: 6.330151350452955

where where is my uncle: 3.905780296097971

bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before: 9.510612127321123

you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course: 7.906254160556875

bennet that is very unlucky: 31.69791513415704

on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley: 10.923348557204958

catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort: 7.983676768946408

it originated in mrs: 6.875970420192837

she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will _make_ her know it: 8.499676318227369

but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on if you had been left to yourself: 14.553542525753812

presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on: 10.672348755013093

and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her: 21.624144120131458

collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it: 8.240032845377469

there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming: 7.123646691545376

but these i suppose are precisely what you are without: 6.105049484314084

i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s: 4.748793520122906

i have not been accustomed to such language as this: 10.004258539145024

you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome: 9.72063366532233

their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr: 9.896099489232396

his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret: 8.212415930759995

darcy about it if you had rather not: 12.189380696620994

we may compare our different opinions: 4.369165772964152

from his garden mr: 3.9276045722070565

they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself: 6.923933676507923

indeed i am: 16.41295292955747

wickham will never marry a woman without some money: 9.960919150424576

i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love said darcy: 5.649094233263922

as she went up stairs to get ready mrs: 12.782698747967984

after a short silence the lady first spoke: 5.319770412084384

without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want: 7.781355732284078

darcy she was directly retreating: 5.10304440846772

they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master madam he is walking towards the little copse: 10.869626347563166

his revenge would have been complete indeed: 7.5080192682148486

poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful: 9.87983852847494

yes sir i know i am: 19.225457951789434

it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_: 5.948954375230499

you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last: 13.204351293523025

which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to: 10.449995092821894

other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons: 9.282245063354564

jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed: 6.315996843101453

in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs: 10.212764489380852

it is highly improper: 5.86906701351304

it cannot be: 12.042894506953104

i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr: 8.68835734945852

mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball: 13.24731909138424

after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet: 10.59555162814527

wickham: 16.932725449083193

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr: 8.61708427303004

only think of _that_ my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time: 9.446284658623286

bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit: 10.523200660320228

if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to: 10.195576948886236

i do not believe she often sees such at home: 9.195626369397946

how strange: 7.822663686466881

f: 2.3679030114881052

she cried: 5.5631317801581295

it was agreed to: 15.319830809312998

i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off: 10.619595796314448

i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him: 7.887875055940209

gardiner: 16.408225407832116

on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place: 7.838792762299302

society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body: 9.927103754101438

i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice: 12.11133295287948

darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift: 6.8363164171501785

think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure: 9.708749435393582

wickham s attention was caught and after observing mr: 16.20756678326492

robinson: 3.4658936678952847

take whatever you like and get away: 7.61552080794012

bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game: 6.138528627516536

i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs: 16.82068054967332

we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect: 6.806086216989843

collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest: 5.993126118189921

he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father: 8.035979951070775

bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr: 6.910945659063418

bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made: 6.967538882147453

collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give: 10.07376668536295

her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented: 10.713858131770428

he only told me what i have now told you: 15.663720797909946

well well and so mr: 12.656870455443789

certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: 5.188169459303981

after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is _your_ turn to say something now mr: 10.216884098204632

most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other: 9.674529838535195

the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected: 10.54410915611

but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant: 14.018028165413819

the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement: 9.530303513104826

gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent: 7.467314302710989

she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge: 11.199708927984831

the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely: 6.8458661276872625

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end: 9.684214692843767

the lucases are very artful people indeed sister: 12.184548098924163

indeed you are mistaken madam: 15.512611406343071

the morrow produced no abatement of mrs: 5.924447601060449

you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time: 10.508375993324385

_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn: 8.605264382338254

younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town: 10.841112913707436

chapter xii: 7.147921603391787

what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand: 9.078400365570362

elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled: 7.673405892406582

hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party: 8.705288871177368

she will follow wherever lydia leads: 8.126716785401154

an hour however saw the whole completed and mr: 5.890111418287691

i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day: 5.5008462438516705

you are not well enough you cannot go yourself: 6.4692056678035925

there is nothing the matter with me: 11.96921545345332

i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy: 6.539780937999789

i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements: 8.785513125660747

you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir: 7.050177175399667

while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough: 8.1976234221436

how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love: 8.797060703809292

darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections: 6.829557603137278

bennet treated the matter differently: 6.902093378291826

a long dispute followed this declaration but mr: 7.6612337217726925

it was first broken by mrs: 4.746099143976174

forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning: 6.3203300613846

but papa is so disagreeable: 10.073351364447594

how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd: 8.134916441364172

there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies: 7.4857364449203425

on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided: 10.458381457565078

and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them: 23.239772413574734

how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned: 9.206429309413945

bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence: 10.566035131617681

i am sure _i_ know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this: 8.710526835454907

what congratulations will then flow in: 7.973610984048075

after a few minutes reflection however she continued i _do_ remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper: 10.081212730370526

and can you likewise declare that there is no _foundation_ for it: 8.740126662109587

we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all: 7.232324795470251

i advise mr: 5.715054997780767

it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it: 9.011694229623664

this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving: 7.812450303079076

i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place: 7.982055609570172

bennet and mrs: 3.1761726728647512

and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam do not go: 9.406433476845526

cried jane: 2.9564699844464166

but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ they are even impartial towards miss king: 8.769815119360713

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene: 8.82369942602604

for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support: 7.281034260157517

bingley must be down again in the summer: 12.753808896280724

and this is your real opinion: 13.067280091817914

it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all: 9.047412636593505

of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself: 8.89815904483351

he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear: 9.949916922442345

they were able to love each other even as well as they intended: 7.691570726138392

he knows where we live: 10.520067334710273

robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest: 9.385378501244102

no i should have turned in a moment: 12.160111839996729

collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence: 12.679702901178239

bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr: 10.348266377510544

yours ever caroline bingley: 4.901463563363368

and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight: 7.456996587486846

darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr: 10.6850581427751

bennet from fighting: 6.890307973120528

from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them: 9.38184139750165

darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him: 9.404640518415958

mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun: 15.313035449676258

you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner: 10.725305371957154

darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr: 9.666482848703389

she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr: 12.83786495018707

darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding: 6.478104857520914

wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more: 6.444369448381198

fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy: 5.974915994299359

with my mother up stairs: 9.24678234018814

thank heaven: 80.44181696736685

this mrs: 9.552217053351548

from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr: 11.148776996005015

elizabeth was delighted: 8.661241555576394

collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself: 8.218266745321579

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield: 6.155080490138379

he was most highly esteemed by mr: 6.255099904703876

bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters: 7.991802344403688

his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it: 8.186682755525823

he was on one side of her mother: 8.486067416446431

i am prodigiously proud of him: 6.5936425585026415

bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on: 12.809706241809707

darcy approaching them and at no great distance: 6.789144814058221

if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark: 8.059320575098749

with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it: 9.483713104916765

it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr: 10.717201522487171

cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr: 7.4961631214867035

i have done with you from this very day: 8.483471551312482

they were natural and just: 7.520033600292524

and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty: 10.581281183942659

what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable: 6.624509635213986

elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her: 9.187941948224822

till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance: 10.64123464771646

her power was sinking every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace: 8.97976098178186

bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party: 9.207653693633334

impossible: 11.254051893530947

seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence: 8.370789937808357

i do not believe mrs: 8.931244159443573

my dear mr: 7.018403703403148

no one made any reply: 8.005378685110626

of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd: 9.773294613019871

now lizzy i think i _have_ surprised you: 9.285984873516648

the adieu is charity itself: 6.725162796746272

bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr: 9.04852689148192

two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge: 9.339273855138233

they must have seen them together for ever: 9.657040468729216

information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment: 6.611766169755389

what am i to do: 10.904483815034823

elizabeth went away with her head full of him: 5.8786896237946245

colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head: 8.903855373661557

it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution: 10.724443216321056

such a charming man: 47.363659131175

darcy s regard: 24.076293995605063

philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason: 7.818942473314397

the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks: 13.887398222672969

her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil: 7.407132631266042

well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him: 8.343981239084762

it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before: 9.547162778439983

why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all: 8.064924113349859

oh yes: 135.76653360849411

she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s: 9.449908170399572

i _have_ heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron: 7.871759126582338

darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition: 18.749265621429156

at length the parsonage was discernible: 9.791610219266262

you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms: 19.46089510959127

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head: 19.981619004635466

but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes: 5.456176999562823

elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances: 7.107875857864338

i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two: 7.088648741882822

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves: 6.652667595295693

you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour: 7.931944070390029

bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before: 7.472709247367143

gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr: 18.13610326250297

philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence: 5.273575863287318

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men: 10.85129887692982

he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before: 12.149753732380715

i would go and see her if i could have the carriage: 6.2290127003578295

you will be a very happy woman: 6.586472610657323

i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr: 7.7593018560037885

said he that is rather singular: 8.417756513921143

but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for: 6.912692987417274

i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right: 9.05535656151903

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine: 16.532622941062968

as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence: 7.6685420362514085

but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them: 12.0236646491543

not handsome enough to dance with: 18.746965064537743

creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you: 7.31513197596251

elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure: 8.32706460659991

to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever: 8.353013829233443

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses: 5.522718359795402

my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room: 14.50443017879113

who instantly taking the alarm set off from b: 5.084731372228553

and _that_ made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter: 9.753455671456754

bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty: 11.448619709766604

bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr: 13.539147699557336

well well said he do not make yourself unhappy: 6.184450474841829

without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment: 13.274453192850105

but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all: 10.918080281622897

cried elizabeth: 1.122936796258918

in ran mrs: 8.501186035268196

importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly: 5.8855926877596865

chapter iv: 7.147921603391787

but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again: 8.335658736880989

bingley s first choice: 5.48101343205828

_you_ may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer: 11.70305959620367

darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together: 17.807273026876373

and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shall not come and part us i am determined: 8.811149445871203

my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not: 8.277075848720392

our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day: 5.672345962419771

his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs: 7.57347724296208

but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties: 8.684280274648618

i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them: 7.558969965975648

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr: 10.448230426235838

yes i have had a letter from him by express: 16.144624730495707

my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing: 11.511848078251024

fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness: 7.428546315018016

these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay: 4.6783288949409805

bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy: 16.907535612369344

instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr: 6.387240410308233

allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer: 11.402763343378055

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr: 9.942407685743895

she shall hear my opinion: 10.02274597508077

i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient: 7.982405971972529

you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much: 8.000161564070254

denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed: 8.582464801783257

i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully: 9.895821664965704

on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr: 15.128901432798862

the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value: 6.585858494301526

my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do: 9.103375770800179

she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers: 6.184512967247269

his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr: 6.205856487689094

louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again: 10.172070311608506

darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister: 5.940798820514972

wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony: 8.244128606221869

said elizabeth: 2.681103528291029

but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow: 8.60369274245622

collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit: 9.108706374493254

yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing: 7.965965690698725

darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident: 10.425287444813474

bingley never stirs without him: 7.473916874793447

bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend: 9.894985076228197

collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london: 5.93836682791761

bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr: 9.41237528856599

it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world: 10.302934794249163

chapter xviii: 7.147921603391787

there can be no love in all this: 24.32223875785701

bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr: 4.86686344724536

chapter xx: 9.682865003888603

he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom: 7.289650865197183

kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do: 11.38394088256797

bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing: 7.791012111132319

and his sisters are charming women: 20.323351554158357

bennet was really in a most pitiable state: 6.880998578028059

you mentioned _two_ instances: 7.150500728519656

how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves: 9.201997486135355

i will not be interrupted: 2.9254421270344317

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities: 7.160730805251567

she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown: 9.243365370337

pray go to see them with sir william and maria: 5.036051132379174

he now wished it more than ever: 18.372282201486176

hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet: 7.952326346603914

lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion: 7.016162631111585

wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball: 10.545611704255041

come be quick be quick: 12.19298696542636

by you i was properly humbled: 6.526179334938408

he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away: 8.657604887367455

she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham: 9.089608009950487

elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr: 9.79751847295432

bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly: 10.129854776371703

you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr: 8.58933394752695

she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs: 6.713162185981458

elizabeth you are not serious now: 11.485643194917355

he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months: 10.193996383894268

she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make _her_ feel the obliged: 9.993645802891521

i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done: 10.284081953927608

my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you: 6.843779505414462

pardon me: 20.720440146460497

i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me: 8.162360354633446

she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property: 9.01161805334053

it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case: 12.11894946830292

elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness: 7.563768103837328

you are safe from me: 4.95021842886789

it adds even another motive: 6.8132493630897155

i came to you without a doubt of my reception: 16.126989098025202

good gracious: 3.845144953238293

bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject: 5.309683517254008

take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment: 5.737724111363522

this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem: 15.272704994315383

but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters: 8.873243523553663

bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for: 11.16159548346258

how could i ever think her like her nephew: 10.947618481244836

darcy seemed much pleased with the attention: 9.451502242751998

my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done: 12.245378568121192

darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was: 8.343863017948257

s: 29.8483178791824

you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you: 13.365049507508926

his plan did not vary on seeing them: 18.768359561586

lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr: 7.507158600642593

are they indeed: 3.5057911779728497

risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence: 11.36026226486522

darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr: 7.985941078132407

perhaps he must if he sees enough of her: 8.424007812224719

e: 1.456341496729785

i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before: 5.683445002324362

then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you: 7.965600858040173

bingley s being imposed on than that mr: 7.589782058091337

oh no: 38.908399039990044

and quite alone: 13.092555330601508

i shall never forget her appearance this morning: 18.24949148125298

for heaven s sake madam speak lower: 9.300264808814974

wickham himself: 9.039650015459305

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tm s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come: 6.689164987603985

to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr: 8.402945646495601

only think what a miserable summer else we shall have: 8.563106650745391

whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable: 4.746395738716702

the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states: 8.326012429289916

said he with a look of doubt: 8.074608170809123

it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter: 14.914059838349207

on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower: 9.46721254426378

they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought: 11.305890483050774

collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power: 10.16506830909649

what think you of _this_ sentence my dear lizzy: 16.400901559952334

darcy might leave the country but that _he_ should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week: 9.330186425170405

bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away: 6.682818822910224

i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if _i_ should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia: 9.05082319195012

he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner: 6.255054081189765

he had to be sure done much: 6.284959894751922

every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr: 13.183868618328624

did you go by the village of kympton: 4.516594223624149

it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley: 10.176865947392077

this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them: 9.331476557109136

poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance: 13.476827725543917

her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds: 21.395561497146076

bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last: 10.712713718367535

if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight: 6.931278447198278

collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels: 8.462958003705157

i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever: 10.669270836870819

none at all: 3.5057911779728497

but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away: 9.206838782320169

darcy you cannot deny the fact: 14.036795433593445

he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her: 7.894841242175053

bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir: 6.683619845848338

what has she to do with it: 20.821324642487262

but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham: 10.934559862454767

having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity: 8.843413099609267

wickham with money: 8.57212622840197

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr: 14.124384261837475

it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it: 6.058878857232464

lydia declared herself satisfied: 4.387217449705222

a small sum could not do all this: 15.961410090498472

proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself: 5.5712802896058635

vol: 29.8483178791824

much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr: 8.784480733443381

all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes: 5.580652361960419

darcy by character perfectly well: 6.169994754409279

where is your sash my dear: 9.493648553954989

such as vanity and pride: 10.915636234396143

this account then is what he has received from mr: 11.599193030909886

her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines: 6.434054188348582

it was all conjecture: 7.563301803459698

darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr: 10.58078938479933

bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy: 5.580697523723786

pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe: 9.393368839564696

elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits: 14.436784320273915

perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones: 5.974843212335002

in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either: 13.16440370410724

came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through: 7.316443636286872

he was to come there with wickham you know: 16.13325819818454

bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year: 7.797213862373861

her colour changed and she said no more: 23.757384351981223

no said darcy i have made no such pretension: 9.847304343656672

there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london: 12.457984815770379

no why should he: 8.964390855746108

ten thousand a year: 10.670681281343485

and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had: 11.839958337347507

what felicity: 9.172205251573164

general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg tm electronic works <NUM>: 8.66442363202669

in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour: 9.31416715418304

my feelings in every respect forbid it: 12.397135260667978

i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford: 6.0669791157980395

i leave it to yourself to determine said mr: 6.947503513719765

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts: 8.63156727894796

i know you will contrive it all: 9.699234301921974

she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out: 11.07365602049458

darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he: 11.308119790218555

there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning: 9.702272969238354

miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself: 8.019787043269167

the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy: 23.219333957072152

i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter: 7.780907265049392

my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you: 9.93412716282701

why did she come: 4.110934758901929

or in other words you are determined to have him: 14.785454408038813

and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses: 11.608060315910556

you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr: 8.883638840985858

a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it: 7.381051247933642

had his character been known this could not have happened: 10.024709506311844

every time they met it was more decided and remarkable: 6.330151350452955

yes in conjunction with his friend: 5.9478273435060665

i should imagine not: 5.310428448885581

she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man: 9.157123169929577

the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome: 10.18796294226568

philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr: 9.956587617800128

we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia: 9.258033185634206

i have sent for you on an affair of importance: 8.341845987410021

is he married or single: 6.47022505055486

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt: 21.597979765838343

at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward: 6.492331805581744

tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s: 11.139481190232242

darcy walk into the room: 22.050623224424324

elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them: 6.813905466699495

i have not been used to submit to any person s whims: 11.18758787108966

to mr: 19.190563347562488

collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day: 6.497094987489397

gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little: 9.581770348621456

they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve: 13.742053602427955

said he hastily as he opened the door: 10.65555874675182

jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr: 9.123516016226345

my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cannot write so i will dictate and you write for me: 8.191734585262317

stop me whilst you can: 5.616830422948574

she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty: 8.055020290057518

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters: 8.783343075314805

they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come mr: 9.616056114568675

when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty: 9.424235289442422

at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house: 8.387657958347091

no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_: 7.739289486005233

bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere: 14.08083488217838

she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference: 9.282198702475856

i certainly shall not: 5.973329252976921

to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own: 10.4957231015608

have you had any flirting: 6.591275839298436

i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at: 7.078873604137507

bennet was not so well pleased with it: 14.628342346164477

these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing: 7.712966040044379

miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other: 10.488020052288975

had colonel forster seen denny himself: 5.442011463260816

i shall see her in january: 13.42566228554365

the effect was immediate: 6.691352078290653

thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart: 9.398274667015379

forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia said she though i am _not_ her particular friend: 6.6241513954020315

but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event: 8.119437939948483

bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr: 13.853764841055854

bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial: 7.504576689157882

chapter vi: 41.8234927634775

bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs: 10.005703807120776

i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression: 8.025418233016568

yes i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care: 13.876480872532571

yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember: 9.689524280738972

darcy could not have: 4.953353140421884

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_ though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better: 9.850322693923868

no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called: 8.451731408570327

jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way: 11.134969432060249

what did you say of me that i did not deserve: 12.25952247426301

gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning: 10.806261498802908

but what said she after a pause can have been his motive: 14.604824261335866

that reply will do for the present: 8.483049743645669

my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party: 8.610987428333111

he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do: 7.735414955485607

in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great: 6.76502276831615

but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr: 7.051776775879412

a clergyman like you must marry: 11.170440371227803

but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character: 8.772604582289958

that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating: 6.568724528732471

i am perfectly serious in my refusal: 4.789984143313898

yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity: 13.451344402268692

but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them: 10.403966212059773

one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual: 7.383302962243684

she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance: 8.678104959196355

elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative: 7.284036094031591

my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this: 10.072751486135497

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme: 10.146214107918691

he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us: 11.527663451144353

lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these: 15.143432674299683

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry: 6.159346168385783

so much ease with such perfect good breeding: 10.675401329427116

_i_ did for you: 5.142758923303551

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr: 11.744122257236462

yet he is _such_ a man: 11.363962355714506

that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him: 8.379729225409744

well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they: 10.660457162548584

but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters: 7.747607746280061

why any fear of detection: 6.659195471324257

in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise: 7.746113768386286

bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy: 10.744348146687614

no no nonsense lizzy: 8.101760831788969

_i_ who knew what he was: 6.104119412451381

but i dare not hope it: 30.199703811026286

why should _he_ have it more than anybody else: 11.503098726102035

elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased: 6.5618834212544925

and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men: 8.429051910293172

i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_: 7.936825524787363

but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies: 9.752742547505845

i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do: 9.805152362816855

his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him: 9.893107958471944

my style of writing is very different from yours: 7.3795387625905144

bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast: 6.661108882160668

younge was of course removed from her charge: 17.391206938261206

in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account: 7.798992546203865

bennet still up: 6.890307973120528

darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself: 10.032554007255113

lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty: 11.268908038823334

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light: 7.855277837504257

it now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors: 10.189507840371766

the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works: 4.126004939986003

but he is an ugly fellow: 10.9075461239943

annesley is with her: 4.128818347738539

she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible: 7.6315641293075736

your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications: 10.902928184870698

as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement: 10.873299899272476

bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr: 7.967767464444785

let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them: 10.0418776561913

you must and shall be married by a special licence: 10.875814147305736

_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly: 7.708800857231371

there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him: 7.704855942283592

bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you: 38.89466742829028

gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him: 7.5847960148618965

can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand: 11.642032872325352

her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament: 9.937011973277489

darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london: 8.788350989129254

my dear dear jane i am so happy: 28.308099906074606

miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt: 4.939340276992853

not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr: 11.640178948459294

a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence: 13.752512010389626

a clear ten thousand per annum: 12.05108969063471

he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed: 14.25977855925692

darcy was condemned as the worst of men: 5.853965312827257

elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them: 8.614748694152743

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door: 10.162673568381276

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate: 11.358024742309286

they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent: 8.315376142815659

elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband: 10.701537410180412

bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice: 8.627099695176561

if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough: 16.04151958872102

i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment: 21.72631104572205

chapter xix: 7.147921603391787

when tea was over mr: 18.892657122987814

bennet was quite in the fidgets: 9.901690787548029

to morrow fortnight: 9.235382793331494

his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn: 11.050113365581733

the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune: 10.940780769720476

the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr: 13.658174476668307

reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room: 6.710744872195898

pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance: 7.464212545955437

did she call to refuse her consent: 5.340327125390202

when you have killed all your own birds mr: 10.121988163504367

i _must_ have employment and society: 6.144002443160097

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share: 9.880315596727835

imprudent as a marriage between mr: 5.818747074035808

my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers: 19.96283244888042

i desire you will do no such thing: 19.23236618672121

bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman: 5.620108233225651

collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr: 9.796477316127573

their reception at home was most kind: 4.85386860755157

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again: 9.211515058306288

jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them: 10.873621154984358

yes almost every day: 5.651959354692553

i never saw any one so shocked: 4.049667929929674

you are not going to be _missish_ i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report: 7.548134631166684

bingley cried his wife: 7.752712822002882

how could i be so silly as to wish it: 13.448755972334514

yes the late mr: 14.805279191342564

the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair: 7.411517707426431

not as you represent it: 9.270083189320694

cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction: 4.792018440880154

thought elizabeth: 9.969899159196563

by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary: 10.551571422001834

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration: 9.72396790414633

what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are: 10.595972112366471

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was: 12.749019030281648

i am afraid you do not like your pen: 7.5708796130702

it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was: 9.486617003320841

i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude: 10.643288359447565

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word: 20.57001998376994

had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs: 5.85150687518728

to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs: 9.073956722067283

darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives: 16.19213330036616

whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes: 7.559937516284769

she was gone directly: 10.025737361709108

he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr: 8.094429915440713

that is the place to get husbands: 6.128417786963

why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me: 10.788587457034593

the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited: 17.031589811735596

bingley: 7.0007264170662955

i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her: 6.668153455672779

gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both: 7.49551312780655

how strange this is: 7.513608237852508

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech: 9.487633203615118

collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted: 8.539664828489833

as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done: 14.882847508445535

whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr: 9.221665240423821

there is nothing he would not do for her: 8.06256436447974

elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more: 10.225988684448016

his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london: 8.07037716686315

perhaps it would have been better replied her sister: 5.4504504771864335

nor did that day wear out her resentment: 9.423649948210144

what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr: 7.66236546349981

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation: 6.095478274498007

not at all: 7.716135253093061

no indeed i did not: 11.057818856689002

bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on: 8.823820993770795

it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she: 7.035598163918869

bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful: 9.7879286133832

this is not quite enough to make her understand his character: 11.454769984966871

hurst nothing at all: 9.170634829712835

chapter iii: 41.8234927634775

elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course: 10.034751047613478

who could have done less for her: 5.477806445500172

but however insincere _you_ may choose to be you shall not find _me_ so: 13.245818907028843

there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table: 8.324107574978074

then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs: 7.210730922112092

after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer: 9.659538595864806

but i was embarrassed: 10.320490776864533

much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married: 9.486732204607241

_that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter: 7.781620410226727

gardiner who was several years younger than mrs: 18.503281250334297

they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs: 7.385406567006935

kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on: 7.626180285067921

they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them: 7.769422512826289

wickham and rejoiced in it: 7.047569638527377

wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland: 9.130978182786295

i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married: 7.833118849079107

what do you mean: 20.50293169809368

she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise: 7.859455088065902

he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it: 8.278274604470534

i hope added mrs: 4.274155762830361

sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance: 8.012625081388018

i am so pleased so happy: 10.640480952665904

i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her: 8.02640707367461

i have nothing to say against _him_ he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better: 12.663364520194051

a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy: 10.010458351872106

but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation: 8.062441336299282

if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy: 11.1934858942156

long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself: 6.843401223093838

cried elizabeth when she had finished it: 7.670119052351556

a great deal of good management depend upon it: 5.678809889825827

not that i mean to find fault with _you_ for such things i know are all chance in this world: 12.451391329912257

this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage: 7.256575713745614

but of this answer lydia heard not a word: 15.859723080776721

were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr: 12.118788914574324

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible: 17.421513427153567

collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr: 6.0153993325872746

and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen: 6.782251562128523

they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family: 9.449425835294354

no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr: 7.1028462437099185

the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with: 8.057704247600851

collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction: 8.384574650391846

occupied in observing mr: 8.832275715885476

bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life: 6.286615572978311

bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased: 7.074343817012204

this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr: 8.348036947906204

while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible: 8.945747985439365

we had better go into the avenue: 13.04892037106297

for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts: 8.4370959171089

it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her: 9.98768852751992

sir william how can you tell such a story: 4.488284197961473

did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring: 7.827304623503747

for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path: 6.527156737677279

wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is: 19.99825895127358

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject: 9.490247292073413

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself: 10.56277977780669

she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste: 6.816012902736061

you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper: 8.271858121417493

chapter vii: 7.147921603391787

it was over at last however: 6.045626968172261

at four of the clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said mr: 11.221235360737229

collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr: 10.408260886899505

do not repeat what i then said: 14.152784086027014

he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before: 11.562163581825931

it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your s_ seems to have been: 6.81635206563176

bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr: 13.107566585154835

elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself: 9.851587588204797

in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness: 8.540560280874741

by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent: 8.033464387955341

and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven of the clock: 7.196960637394128

my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents: 7.986375047036333

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening: 6.485161550473269

i never heard of such a thing: 5.54163473689246

my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other: 6.778389228815603

as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch: 13.156416149686807

_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest: 6.771108777627719

first of all he asked miss lucas: 8.212555810427483

if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes: 15.16853663246834

gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on: 9.352351131777217

do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent: 12.82981097750171

bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer: 12.4663838302016

pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam: 11.859902964653802

he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him: 7.9883468178224755

those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable: 8.347827210393033

and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless: 9.12333141712075

but so we all do: 23.24176366846154

i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here: 11.14027568063939

her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us: 20.168455253442485

darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents: 10.899858872261754

he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen: 5.605093017613146

you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness: 7.748159861333009

i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire: 7.797697365291954

chapter viii: 7.147921603391787

when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted: 9.137282917966024

as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination: 10.862132772450197

and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn: 14.293403502047761

the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent: 8.806709459920059

they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound: 10.043571765661031

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word: 14.550387847072516

well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them: 18.694475719694783

is my father in town: 5.366809609133862

i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection: 7.858411421719214

she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet: 17.302664045967052

let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers: 7.783734200874787

it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor: 5.755380775345944

to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her: 10.566279061239811

very odd: 6.14443119026147

hurst were going out: 9.670977613428956

we have heard only once: 6.311171060591802

the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility: 7.799967010297211

yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had: 10.402843706075693

can i have the carriage: 3.618460447701537

to mrs: 6.115056373719641

he arranges the business just as he pleases: 11.705293978594257

collins on his return highly gratified mrs: 6.650779119848435

and they are really to be married: 10.298104650015384

elizabeth longed to observe that mr: 19.542615235719204

this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west: 12.100991354085977

i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again: 7.282882693166278

my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again: 11.672358199631224

i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him: 7.167223404491869

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was: 7.333117606605328

you need not distress yourself: 14.169764567989667

collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish: 9.208420927966735

consider how important every moment is in such a case: 6.330151350452955

kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr: 6.9065596074296325

collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs: 7.871320955042809

on this subject what can you have to say: 10.703812118716167

bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother: 15.64839633517433

collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party: 18.86792183627055

darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her: 9.658183345306725

till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness: 11.573510454420544

gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham: 8.073260873514203

if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs <NUM>: 12.915534762579325

not perhaps of neglecting his own interest: 8.690178035592075

his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham: 11.06493607055796

what did colonel forster say: 12.356372189101377

a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their _three_ months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_: 13.182798322370237

it is very hard to think that she might have been mr: 4.285826549478125

but if i were you i would stand by the nephew: 5.341508104946661

i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up: 10.059108794044077

bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever: 12.96041417451357

elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply: 9.274889862010774

i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr: 11.540462358648409

but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then: 9.66064048693799

it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go: 10.792786928247487

my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church: 8.11822913262529

the tête à tête surprised them: 9.820161692509211

collins: 3.9314149600514545

it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them: 11.613350042519754

in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence: 8.600719583412259

you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form: 8.291777090643311

the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood: 8.317033889016423

in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach: 9.880584824065613

philips s: 5.3997654212226145

wickham s intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army: 8.295293873205797

you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world: 8.32456086857421

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr: 9.194894719487769

how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter: 11.824674266045124

but slyness seems the fashion: 6.63172385046455

my father however is partial to mr: 13.250337592325286

though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced: 10.977478321927077

she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal: 7.32329860514353

nearly three weeks: 16.64510142004184

darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued: 9.06926701434567

_that_ you certainly shall: 3.9276045722070565

as a child i was taught what was _right_ but i was not taught to correct my temper: 9.415347209506287

he has children of his own and may have more: 5.952779465266921

but is it certain absolutely certain: 6.668492540526745

well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day: 8.751680543598615

it cannot be concealed from any one: 14.0635011127417

and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs: 9.195219627722066

she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks: 11.259940455018645

but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture: 7.411853672102985

how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls: 11.619831914211106

bennet s manor: 7.465870259915931

but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly: 9.828504144040688

hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort: 10.420768494509147

i am the happiest creature in the world: 7.975213342134779

there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king: 4.768139708030718

gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off: 7.166318965775054

bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton: 9.23279211196482

and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them: 8.744096696045679

darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand: 9.698174377485191

it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on: 8.53194320458575

gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south: 11.563385217567825

nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states: 10.80809826029024

if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him: 7.173864292231342

bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage: 6.515878578702131

things are settled so oddly: 5.616830422948574

never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f: 7.891536826302938

his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them: 13.570359874680031

gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction: 7.718492380910544

when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish: 6.908012360357865

miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice: 7.3679484975232095

if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs: 6.741921571136586

i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement: 6.760531822097571

jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline: 7.2514484351184105

it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it: 6.610856820229762

his doing so drew her notice: 11.58418813880852

bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend: 9.306735701361877

what is mr: 35.47273574463164

i do not trust my own partiality: 8.374641553120204

exceedingly well: 4.797141785693573

after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match: 10.405608904516496

bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr: 8.111780204733167

he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her: 13.601261432800829

i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me: 9.507732950478708

steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her: 8.762921734845955

hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments: 6.3676114494497575

forster the delight of mrs: 6.693223524335083

from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him: 8.34413560173629

she is almost three and twenty: 10.15462973705417

i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs: 8.47133316896531

it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do: 11.876005543241138

but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied: 9.571257904632148

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman madam: 16.241240485265028

but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr: 9.61462412734305

i quite detest the man: 8.411071755455268

do not distress me by the idea: 19.590500449927763

no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind: 10.609271387362327

if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment: 8.530546460239577

nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy: 9.1897634540633

for god s sake say no more of his partners: 13.581305909632633

collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure: 7.074981012514879

not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr: 10.406309895494545

yes there can for mine is totally different: 7.442821083823338

it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing: 8.06577886698856

after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read: 7.807990027271546

he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr: 9.16518969668483

four nieces of mrs: 4.012042543802444

at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him: 12.462094921285562

howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs: 6.962834746811132

they were all astonished and mr: 4.5876234936336555

do you play and sing miss bennet: 14.563822559915945

he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune: 7.064953562981795

she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body: 8.454643841591505

she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held: 8.069784486046666

never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her: 11.412405768761001

how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day: 7.3412334550697445

but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure: 9.345748544420587

elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible: 9.669248545919437

i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done: 6.056425243655846

we _will_ know where we have gone we _will_ recollect what we have seen: 9.525736869386131

that it ought not to be attempted: 11.693184422455634

this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given: 8.74161623685758

collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him: 9.249090593290218

elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr: 8.097306672303727

if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh: 13.586342230237467

it is useless to talk of it: 8.673982803076782

bennet alarmed: 6.880012252507415

has she any family: 6.396364891339011

darcy may be guessed: 6.0514512668250715

he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases: 6.278027239569846

if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation: 8.578349108083719

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year: 4.68660611478173

she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend: 8.012129200876954

section <NUM>: 18.62367781589758

my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking: 8.780268040149625

miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr: 6.232760276934922

well much good may it do them: 8.556734124139199

we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice: 7.454944501818677

it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever: 13.730521333426694

here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of: 15.272208859794828

my dear aunt this is being serious indeed: 8.464883125813413

vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously: 7.63714155943142

my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much: 8.920174244865835

their visits to mrs: 2.941538084749571

who do you mean my dear: 9.000494838350733

i cannot quite agree with you _there_: 5.135346371049155

there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard: 8.502660997402522

but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt: 13.318465702015652

to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed: 10.138936310289271

in three volumes: 5.905961403019355

the strangeness of mr: 4.845900522804927

the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her: 7.197858641505593

what a charming amusement for young people this is mr: 11.474607312668725

pride and prejudice a novel: 17.9891203341951

e below: 3.490322681654163

indeed i could not: 10.15380692529543

if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable: 8.899281802388339

had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it: 10.72634254397945

is not this an agreeable surprise: 12.858800287803081

when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist: 10.195614413942062

after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr: 8.366847586930296

i have no right to give _my_ opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise: 11.185585090899474

when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible: 9.448735684418967

she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr: 7.996259003482457

i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town: 8.117260554468363

ten thousand a year and very likely more: 38.50615960494741

not these two or three years perhaps: 7.885084128308502

but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs: 9.125261134094133

till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr: 7.747246299510421

i suspected as much replied elizabeth: 5.695021337807596

she is a most charming young lady indeed: 5.181978268583149

with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart: 6.159346168385783

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter: 6.847000714603648

wont it kitty: 5.163608515151185

the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity: 8.059918805732595

hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her: 10.3209514743953

what a good joke it will be: 8.410586622625548

as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was: 7.705955838107251

consider mr: 9.969899159196563

the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is <NUM> <NUM>: 6.292823605466184

with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee: 12.637294187705626

it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are: 6.9292468106853145

after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice: 8.215759693429627

she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still: 11.429412118786429

well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now: 11.768982910867857

he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room: 7.654701704734002

he must be an oddity i think said she: 8.349028634443323

her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself: 9.70817134008324

elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr: 9.571319929369842

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information: 7.686930195500441

he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london: 9.360499351019117

bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out: 9.797823828658276

but _now_ we may be silent: 13.859127193442706

and above all things keep mr: 10.314635421723079

collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence: 9.370542457208266

tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure: 26.3418242365106

bennet instantly answered oh dear: 6.902093378291826

the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr: 9.419679842702337

i owe all that i know of it to another not to you: 8.479631887118659

indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not: 14.196799642056186

darcy that they scarcely ever saw him: 12.377340294034598

she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house: 11.145160755897013

she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr: 6.781347845070993

i hate such false friends: 9.173083896190182

she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class: 9.272050214611122

your first position is false: 8.760242201601136

elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal: 6.684990554082828

darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found: 10.73340456497634

but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city: 7.709736722439259

of what are you talking: 12.64894190410319

bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem: 11.803240958461867

it is impossible: 16.802810659013034

darcy did not wish for cards and mr: 5.594115645056667

it was a fortnight since mrs: 5.156830524432144

and have you answered the letter: 15.004724606903311

i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own: 11.752403913755838

collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably: 9.002727786004105

but self though it would intrude could not engross her: 6.755080890110411

family pride and _filial_ pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this: 8.659979616012013

so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great: 6.723659181602395

gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces: 11.799128649706875

collins you must send a servant with them: 18.88686182880724

they have at least that advantage: 5.446202646202212

true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room: 9.762827730090736

he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over: 8.339677677913832

she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr: 8.378215879175677

she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who _did_ call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give: 8.830533953234216

i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings: 8.85647645264842

but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done: 8.475393796747646

a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year: 23.66665652205129

_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance: 7.162934206840224

is she handsome: 3.5057911779728497

we do not suffer by _accident_: 13.389060374878985

when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses: 8.463735666541732

my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point: 10.292907177120233

she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more: 6.832207571038408

lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home: 8.340805840506395

she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers: 8.969119171514485

to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh: 7.278830925306268

at five of the clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner: 11.944771729674953

she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome: 10.10445216145312

oh well: 9.007970174854602

in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness: 9.866687325730743

the second began: 6.644302452653575

how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton: 9.103966201604186

collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove: 11.854753812114332

the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object: 7.841923551809321

if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards: 8.134834889479878

then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman: 9.318753512298033

had it been your uncle s doing i must and _would_ have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way: 7.030813373949506

miss darcy the daughter of mr: 13.11879504350475

_i_ shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you: 9.101922471765198

sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs: 4.672984727050784

she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns: 22.12841231261365

that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger: 9.682610268643629

of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work: 10.661900676263638

bennet s expectations were fully answered: 7.26087391034294

i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do: 10.393394742349082

but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity: 8.212611650794894

i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear: 7.330259465801114

i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage: 8.13938619865973

c: 3.550329640085917

they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same: 13.393343198633085

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house: 9.55222291709135

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend: 8.777343222834356

collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr: 7.623697893895294

you may depend on it replied the other for mrs: 9.516922806251587

i am only ashamed of his asking so little: 7.5425501948521045

her father lifted up his eyes: 15.413843564484596

bennet replied that he had not: 8.343638770535252

but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon: 6.760985662678718

if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them: 11.522605757737594

each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr: 8.145083289166186

long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously: 9.46892559682078

and of this place thought she i might have been mistress: 7.805437781432162

on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away: 16.762649504236407

but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt: 10.352884566583933

i am sure i shall break _mine_ said lydia: 5.049062961913717

i am not at all afraid of her dying: 11.333624698473502

bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of: 6.7881852681422234

they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit: 9.463547299397714

when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same: 13.772529967661406

when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr: 10.151796071733287

i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love: 7.23977468055746

collins as the wisest thing she ever did: 7.096328700332724

long has promised to introduce him: 6.049270147704716

you are all to come to pemberley at christmas: 8.93606090526482

darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister: 9.269120979856527

if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you: 7.257960699346715

they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself: 10.876162896909783

i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little _endeavour_ at civility i am thus rejected: 11.261592258395153

but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him: 8.116830133045427

i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject: 10.655480605077525

we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home: 5.503226942158295

i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women: 9.533746348800923

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr: 6.338348227231347

she finds miss pope a treasure: 9.571233760863539

as for jane _her_ anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to: 10.803802100735384

i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future: 6.948887497382479

we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine: 8.364245233728342

haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off: 8.039642333902211

she had obtained private intelligence that mr: 6.135830187097849

he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant: 10.248575681014675

darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach: 8.308915557059061

it is no such thing: 5.568125066688936

no never: 10.194431561793612

collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise: 8.481860085262324

his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips: 7.222305200073501

collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long: 9.23958973110091

do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenberg tm works unless you comply with paragraph <NUM>: 11.717074623674717

she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you: 7.387361491240062

the possibility of mr: 3.689207871863339

bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit: 10.346439679165677

yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over: 7.211368084717033

the dejection was almost universal: 6.725162796746272

she is grown so brown and coarse: 6.975103468690598

wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison: 9.926410617199647

her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself: 9.150539180194675

darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me: 7.890097641747225

sir william had been delighted with him: 5.640767844364701

your s c: 6.723027658121836

said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam: 5.541145256004197

she is a very good kind of girl i believe: 10.32797346975306

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right: 8.846693713939976

bennet by talking in this way: 18.182445558977378

collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her: 7.92009025964883

but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour: 7.753387452707505

and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over: 9.743095475011256

i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr: 11.014939053326085

information about the mission of project gutenberg tm project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers: 7.303011468834144

she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked: 11.09851977284677

i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_: 7.341664711927291

my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour: 9.523246692062097

i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point: 7.956547385792739

it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity: 6.879595927519722

breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday: 8.529298662008843

she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial: 9.812709030833402

jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears: 6.099213659085437

but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill: 16.445235579063365

bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him: 7.725139490190383

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance: 8.567062284712048

we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs: 6.153713486636489

he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem: 11.443259749771206

lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all: 7.150270189738295

hurst was observing their game: 9.22164437577833

but you know married women have never much time for writing: 5.831936935381163

yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover: 8.15329328744482

her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious: 8.90496410438104

five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs: 7.45169417823408

hart was the originator of the project gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone: 5.619746257607184

she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible: 8.51217497434046

it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr: 12.006639954387879

at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable: 17.634486975361853

lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia: 9.053284186237436

_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam: 9.506792567709487

under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief: 6.400543703376888

no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night: 12.327630116327637

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family: 7.540835243632293

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected: 7.343590416978028

but they did pass away and mr: 7.476058464555973

darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned: 6.72305856189259

elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off: 9.978559503273269

chapter v: 7.147921603391787

elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal: 6.208053334591664

so much the better: 13.180388589481772

when mr: 5.82237486454241

they came: 8.081135709577147

if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence: 6.742788018160358

that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs: 9.899983293738595

as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room: 8.72968407426653

however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves: 10.594932591685833

bingley since you went away said mrs: 12.322894841293166

exclaimed elizabeth you are too good: 12.093101299197805

his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion: 7.008405928119514

i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her: 8.205352558646434

there is nothing else to be done: 7.753282761507858

a thousand things may arise in six months: 8.052023525823586

she cried this is delightful indeed: 6.154004276517921

when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer: 9.297672533679792

darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s: 8.376853503999543

he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north: 11.527663451144353

if: 9.29904712989309

catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing: 7.1236054459448965

again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification: 10.195312893370053

my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these: 19.57560022093268

her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness: 7.727695437255361

bingley and talked of mrs: 7.2516858463371054

i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read: 12.401240347580627

to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love: 7.876075063472074

elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr: 10.763653048825864

she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance: 8.889304280147359

chapter ix: 7.147921603391787

bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph: 11.035177006212312

i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older: 9.696395572854069

lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty: 7.510901909126301

no no: 8.758928203129484

amongst the most violent against him was mrs: 8.016376379594796

in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective: 11.325102891525933

i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish: 9.712704805278435

i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters: 14.318652387626193

well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr: 16.00288759294279

it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother as well as of her s: 6.101847464951614

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well: 7.475078155864404

he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected: 6.964559773525894

no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton: 7.449075339628339

but _your_ arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family: 10.722315016063256

repeated mr: 4.884528382130216

darcy looked therefore she could not tell: 13.213055778043515

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton: 11.808777930388311

such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon: 7.063601619262382

she dared not even mention that gentleman: 7.4468308174431534

when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane: 8.378520218480105

at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here: 12.78371500410613

said mr: 2.633137277774649

yes he introduced us to his sister: 8.476872693842584

darcy improves on acquaintance: 6.695775835231775

when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away: 17.484918901412843

the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and mrs: 10.658574733040881

between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard: 10.834245530691913

this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors: 9.02173939343713

i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen: 7.590901187298635

the other is miss de bourgh: 5.9977659828484

general information about project gutenberg tm electronic works: 8.91530491595413

if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all: 10.542072749640143

no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: 8.272548483433903

this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for: 8.25328689026115

you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful: 13.368411364349408

darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley: 6.37184522396691

and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north: 9.006588126295116

she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley: 8.904867118672428

in as short a time as mr: 6.924937770001995

the moment of her release from him was ecstacy: 8.871741640859732

have you heard from my uncle: 8.943777037051639

an easy distance do you call it: 9.1147595307398

she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave: 13.076771434555187

elizabeth looked archly and turned away: 19.996187623644104

darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr: 12.65385858929384

wickham is safe: 15.614468016022881

collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too: 8.656319212502254

collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_: 6.517323009629022

miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards: 18.645602692702983

believe her to be deceived by all means: 13.79349678388384

well and what news does it bring: 11.844362401766748

not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body: 15.69639740791825

but let me advise you to think better of it: 21.899849072952236

while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing: 10.106777042446637

wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters: 8.971619607885456

she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different: 9.583750045049353

they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered: 11.767145491029604

it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed: 9.060661080712137

he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her: 17.103590082712145

it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr: 4.821650133313256

i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long: 6.583359924984393

i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it: 5.965210213821656

but however he did not: 15.363470289994961

miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs: 9.159806239662611

the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow: 12.366595476095046

his character was to speak for itself: 7.389017212967848

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it: 9.082470086694611

i hope my dear said mr: 10.755679488705217

what will become of me: 16.19191449879547

bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness: 11.604604843735464

she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room: 10.230158696929232

darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot: 8.515474540087048

but she is nothing to me now: 8.402359150507438

and her calling here was prodigiously civil: 9.869022821874614

intending to trace their route: 5.616830422948574

astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her: 5.8855926877596865

hurst soon found even his open petition rejected: 8.464801059776416

but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us: 13.813444247603057

you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address: 6.1493591181749165

but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it: 20.017327834525823

imagine our surprise: 5.163608515151185

how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr: 7.654237207301394

i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection: 14.828865960595559

you alluded to something else: 10.813229334125163

no but it must be done soon: 9.258795726098016

he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable: 7.829092739515404

such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned: 9.91168539054082

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed: 6.173469842343469

she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him: 7.800282607002519

has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves: 6.605329205660009

nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related: 9.164176272220415

collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete: 7.42146374870496

but that is one great difference between us: 26.652564354217738

i will think no more about him: 4.387904668704531

as for their mother mr: 10.688915251108295

sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers: 7.08204703767535

do you draw: 10.631094147638626

elizabeth could bear it no longer: 6.3675381551003

it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else: 11.388964581062579

and when we _do_ return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing: 7.303943198915332

bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk: 6.098364047208005

it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing: 15.216804852750366

denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire: 23.4975757716741

do let me ask my partner to introduce you: 10.055688721488412

collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day: 9.884255283144721

why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks: 6.829187966838093

but it is all all too late now: 4.595768761698867

you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us: 10.670128328902344

she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham: 13.983408965033583

it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit: 7.218419359176364

this must be the grossest falsehood: 15.675537420031457

you are joking lizzy: 5.178417577378787

would mr: 4.884528382130216

pursuing her way along the lane she then began it: 7.824461719802057

lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use: 9.283352194361356

bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr: 8.085307956670375

lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off: 5.943690775408744

collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me: 8.13127667979003

unfeeling selfish girl: 5.163608515151185

i should take him even on _my_ slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man: 8.90242632961021

she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion: 7.426675874572875

that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion: 6.898662055292538

one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself: 9.979535095570252

what all five out at once: 9.760146817856107

i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth: 7.878291900009441

we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire: 12.249003396671837

his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy: 10.195845722511088

i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship: 18.99298297440496

i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent: 8.660482581722011

gardiner was so little to be trusted: 20.636113544902592

it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills: 8.65290956448837

the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me: 11.813192622943216

forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away: 8.080116266480461

after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr: 8.417147599511257

bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr: 8.924201225239006

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again: 8.187017899175036

nobody wants him to come: 18.04969767219985

people do not die of little trifling colds: 5.9826667937042535

that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily: 7.197198542158799

so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him: 5.278951688683023

said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am: 4.26770065960516

i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds: 5.421932168086709

on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me: 8.573179376961496

he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world: 8.530440758488961

but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered: 13.246074251362131

gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w: 8.23213170213894

dear madam cried mrs: 9.70174123604214

my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel: 8.584028969648127

and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false: 7.909395914428072

then taking the disengaged arm of mr: 3.8276981951809694

he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily: 11.134659008571454

i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object: 8.624388531815274

i know them a little: 4.199371672361341

but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea: 8.21321333952316

i can much more easily believe mr: 5.553992136919748

how should you have liked making sermons: 10.83117813286487

darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred: 6.773493388946586

bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs: 5.669801256743284

bingley is come: 13.82928122644155

here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell: 7.084642971143884

if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one: 7.974752493578087

if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him: 11.477399971951982

i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least: 5.609358492059009

i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister: 6.64958585281112

bingley if she could: 32.69013207121712

in a short time i shall have a daughter married: 10.788700547535813

such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st: 9.044602760360572

women fancy admiration means more than it does: 5.9826667937042535

smiles decked the face of mrs: 4.5997394061151065

i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy: 8.996359123746954

elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh: 11.17281374714376

this information however startled mrs: 12.64635898423742

you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people: 19.18405036384219

his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes: 12.437327081768691

against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr: 7.795599168682361

collins who was complimenting mr: 7.242426322420621

her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted: 8.975373015424134

after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me: 6.580066023268188

every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections: 5.899556041336122

yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it: 12.770659802573245

darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable: 9.815466106507738

she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening: 9.473566311479116

they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt: 8.024630005264397

and a special licence: 19.17778928843105

let me do it without farther loss of time: 8.977712942309925

lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr: 12.845526907860798

many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory: 10.844018517842736

we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice: 5.366601682711136

interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other: 9.994718819151121

neglect: 4.243243607058394

i think she will be pleased with the hermitage: 15.717855097683476

very well and this offer of marriage you have refused: 8.250045915023888

bennet was quite disconcerted: 11.151510709388836

i dearly love a laugh: 6.039038752423456

this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed: 7.828691206401337

their fortune on both sides is splendid: 4.537261105542127

they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister: 8.836749584770198

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect: 12.384689520204867

it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried: 5.803958621872191

i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require: 8.558183797933157

all was joy and kindness: 10.915636234396143

has your governess left you: 4.259629614139935

did you see it: 5.528403291957267

you will not be fit to be seen when you get there: 7.616659219250582

tell me once for all are you engaged to him: 9.245010923429433

bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would: 7.734915863073826

i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked: 6.032091666358456

that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter: 11.19516513815649

you tear them to pieces: 7.1188175892237675

to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate: 12.141694187321285

bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house: 14.07628568608389

jane s is nothing to it nothing at all: 8.029351403949626

you are uniformly charming: 5.178417577378787

with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr: 6.731593435134723

that is not very likely our authority was too good: 8.535070927048578

but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs: 7.253341785304715

true: 11.52822268576161

have you seen any pleasant men: 6.632890707278276

she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility: 11.69253277466228

it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it: 10.268916300794816

with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself: 17.838241288079853

i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now: 10.924569924100934

gardiner thought of him and mrs: 5.744192378188929

elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs: 7.882673659404781

you see how continually we are engaged there: 12.679524605027753

let us sit down: 5.240353880487925

collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted: 7.459575385098893

to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr: 6.926741074649146

in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs: 10.634533046795974

miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former: 6.595484529816506

lizzy declares she will not have mr: 4.986527906370131

i did not think mrs: 4.39898448664186

and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them: 8.554788970024475

darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence: 7.703444001809346

sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise: 8.66635442351495

their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves: 8.83511500100004

all connection between us seemed now dissolved: 5.150112360866509

if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine: 10.286390354188562

bennet s civilities: 7.465870259915931

at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion: 12.22769414372943

but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion: 9.98766864671617

collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance: 8.471545263607652

perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth: 5.247011144590344

she replied in the affirmative: 10.02274597508077

had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd: 8.427274619496714

and they _must_ marry: 11.775871791813497

and gravely glancing at mr: 6.590251018238481

mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached: 10.580911273438794

her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty: 9.262832585394712

darcy that mr: 17.420077491624006

i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_: 11.919353659637856

who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly: 4.515530015579962

jane was beyond competition her favourite child: 7.604970866348767

darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings: 11.981879033814176

to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open: 8.58203794024071

he is as fine a fellow said mr: 4.426377935049909

five daughters brought up at home without a governess: 9.767876930072624

he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement: 8.009217752820652

i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr: 8.846654687341262

he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday: 8.162544217966124

do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share: 6.338255889110146

that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance: 6.061753107700336

good heaven: 16.019500588518518

she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means: 7.725558324270227

you judge very properly said mr: 5.570021630727694

but i am at his disposal: 18.41931928987255

upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield: 9.849864938587269

they were hopeless of remedy: 7.520033600292524

it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage: 11.748741122695298

i cannot see why mrs: 4.713578218158606

he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beauty: 9.61624815117228

she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs: 8.308489140794084

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion: 9.245269831251852

write to me very often my dear: 5.933004594574071

resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned: 13.514462154251929

every thing being settled between _them_ mr: 4.436798462835477

when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both: 10.057623217309477

lord bless me: 4.573236591645489

but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required: 8.049665006674015

but consider your daughters: 6.583014102490491

let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself: 6.894281636877177

their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them: 6.864689584429818

if there _were_ but such another man for you: 8.756757794026107

darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr: 11.203180519718792

regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr: 7.370451505300295

perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now: 16.77496323743114

they must be a great loss to _your_ family: 17.846204999585563

wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr: 9.16193194854583

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley: 9.268315623544282

i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me so before: 13.518305726959335

will you come and see me: 11.464917329148314

he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane: 9.972124567452653

find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her: 6.421438980647691

for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof: 8.687229332768334

the discussion of mr: 7.891870834026703

your uncle: 21.701220908789345

elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man: 7.250866108115503

said her mother: 8.698092685815663

her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity: 8.73800734110009

the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr: 8.19695408094068

lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter: 12.119787293124583

i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself: 10.004668178386646

lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome: 9.687924288670093

oh my dear lizzy: 7.68976231792182

she went on: 11.6157400344142

the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend: 7.996199041764937

bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object: 11.710424229869036

but not before they went to brighton: 23.44861609583739

when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence: 9.632231470209986

perhaps we might be deceived: 4.731010981958166

or why did he thus come a day before he was expected: 14.471013181937137

i appeal to mr: 10.137165800238519

miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed: 16.956427074731433

i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful: 10.4818094638708

i never saw a more promising inclination: 4.049667929929674

hurst: 13.492873028073614

there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know: 12.719318544048345

have not you always hated him: 5.418780187075274

but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered: 8.147993107876225

to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents: 10.170929075890664

elizabeth made no answer: 1.9464020098990944

you have no compassion on my poor nerves: 9.236578053248587

indeed i have sir was her answer: 19.2060774144738

darcy took her advice and did finish his letter: 10.369544219668619

he placed himself by her: 22.836908759690452

i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time: 4.571990029244061

something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life: 8.386638270614522

i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so: 13.622830296391394

reynolds was of no trifling nature: 4.52694166672929

the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father: 9.344669740163376

i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir: 12.436353181744527

i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins: 7.610198826870185

now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself: 10.601596592425608

i am confident that she would have performed delightfully: 5.317132597357307

cried mrs: 11.686822605989427

gardiner s behaviour laid them all under: 6.22452508857116

miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place: 13.59554077655609

we must trespass a little longer on your kindness: 4.155504066025227

said jane as she finished it: 9.71752384319005

she was teazed by mr: 5.525680402296475

true said mr: 3.556789063458173

on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer: 15.516369076790458

after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations: 8.633831742154594

i will have no reserves from _you_: 18.435726981944747

i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing: 6.420709248153856

from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry: 9.105933941497339

these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not: 7.608682407201353

i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these: 5.637458508942555

in the hall they parted: 5.576598659798878

darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton: 10.751821031926339

is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring: 5.118026539170697

most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility <URL> this web site includes information about project gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks: 6.096300371769798

you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for _your_ approbation alone: 8.098936696807403

follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can: 8.539249148654623

<NUM> through <NUM>: 54.13441573678626

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention: 14.442964527170389

collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr: 10.113730232430754

but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife: 9.11982026886056

if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs: 10.285647974904036

an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth: 9.750782272062615

you write uncommonly fast: 7.150500728519656

had i known what i ought what i dared to do: 5.32920160825044

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion: 8.738750246647465

the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd: 6.819686751969617

how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains: 10.955422582788199

she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with: 7.513527785603281

he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again: 7.858869899091075

darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him: 5.941959439314655

in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam: 9.061434035581055

for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness: 9.133148545722218

collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed: 10.322172166662906

it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions: 6.739573597783806

i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday: 6.814598600042816

i should like to know how he behaves among strangers: 10.000348565248293

i must find mr: 5.1010105086388675

bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so: 10.334580300324452

yes i do comprehend a great deal in it: 18.19762244194984

charlotte the wife of mr: 2.7159658691242687

her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs: 13.627572497069021

and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount: 7.107667670191305

we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him: 10.503591549969027

wickham lydia were all forgotten: 8.06734771528386

wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker: 8.641878162864884

are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy: 5.700703375777206

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready: 7.628100298399681

i have not a doubt of your doing very well together: 10.607864453545773

bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him: 8.65597845013538

she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse: 7.495183772645517

he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing: 10.840063284048629

after this day jane said no more of her indifference: 15.490540743974218

how is such a man to be worked on: 23.98391432608852

elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected: 7.519689325131372

he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her: 14.683987776492337

darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them: 7.785940487034846

and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again: 9.31350896465293

in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr: 7.6706370287124415

for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body: 7.9237180168837895

my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says: 15.687595357362031

bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept: 11.797004933509907

for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her: 7.032686317956056

i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming: 11.394252417531881

collins i think: 11.552289270046932

darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her: 9.034006197028166

she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller: 8.577387381273457

in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library: 13.362679693501704

but do not imagine it was from any silly cause: 21.4224225731763

the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention: 10.750044716802714

we neither of us perform to strangers: 4.59906332488902

bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask: 10.50334027165886

have you never happened to see her there: 10.839171920810426

her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said: 10.48482617201708

collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary: 7.341947492645776

a man who had felt less might: 15.202621202231452

chapter xvi: 7.147921603391787

bennet thus began the projected conversation: 6.905780449781635

she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself: 7.477088679387575

the express was sent off directly: 20.225851215822402

how so: 9.104722373922607

he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us: 12.840245191851402

if you _will_ thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone: 6.461018623495487

but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you: 16.444252298258256

has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage: 12.698132405091101

sure he will not leave london before he has found them: 8.843049020005887

she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter: 8.306042993082306

how are you all: 22.049607360629306

the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch: 8.610600710725983

i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas: 7.983379852831792

you give me fresh life and vigour: 7.076791672195455

it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself: 11.306236785980198

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation: 9.81189598914624

collins knew not what to make of him: 9.297946042744504

project gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission: 8.504353535466365

but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage: 10.621199177681444

you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg tm works: 11.243341326352404

bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend: 7.554880895062801

a gamester: 10.081104210313455

why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing: 5.278654708135236

well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love: 12.005907956155985

you are lucky in having such a master: 7.797152963009962

she has known him only a fortnight: 8.048671152420752

my dear father i congratulate you: 23.77113506478197

during their walk it was resolved that mr: 7.541766320807907

colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm: 7.760518594805455

she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct: 7.788450419820376

but that is nothing to us: 34.90829902169942

she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times: 11.61281866199487

lady catherine sir william and mr: 8.359675300241115

she is so fond of mrs: 6.007167741326363

bennet very dull for several days: 6.905780449781635

she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley: 14.9214397934779

you must not disappoint your father: 18.61923559056669

hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it: 12.120395069718723

her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved: 7.822930995975447

no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph: 10.059613386278947

what shall we do with him: 6.25965651950084

i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper: 8.348060035033065

to be only just _tolerable_: 10.719979228273337

darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes: 10.182961146392735

collins and me have a little conversation together: 5.889604399814439

what relates to yourself is as follows: 7.850501625153057

we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye: 4.953947436457741

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time: 9.250833602450314

but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion: 9.256012018751619

it mortifies me: 6.7664592243730235

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him: 8.382750758502032

but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not: 8.309821440420784

i think she will: 14.407550177418091

yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office: 7.507305542967568

it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason: 7.328591486608316

collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters: 8.90204022554891

hear me in silence: 8.832275715885476

the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence: 9.389933655494572

anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil: 9.053198696676914

from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce: 10.057861662677569

collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery: 10.044334288453454

not yet replied jane: 15.846389391577247

it is not quite a week since they left brighton: 7.340145424772508

_you_ began the evening well charlotte said mrs: 5.047918593356271

that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance: 11.914242180691117

my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made: 8.529405552448885

gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself: 8.058256493699746

there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name: 8.712928247133453

i am excessively attentive to all those things: 10.830150737970042

elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate: 9.734720103634332

bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all: 10.350630277855046

it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it: 9.711839547444699

and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s: 9.644715806758846

bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr: 8.271673541033334

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment: 8.645712499653653

hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep: 13.673331031675458

cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr: 6.925203392112564

if one could but go to brighton: 129.72325905853916

darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband: 8.165321369689014

georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother: 10.980342296480973

a glass of wine shall i get you one: 7.943093917559398

collins but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it: 6.201249505502919

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile: 7.027575216471547

jane was not happy: 12.972797670820375

indeed: 9.11147257706624

who are your uncles and aunts: 4.52694166672929

assistance is impossible condolence insufferable: 5.616830422948574

this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley: 12.384792248298668

do you often dance at st: 11.084756456487387

lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr: 9.288881247272737

do not let us quarrel about the past: 9.255357991261171

it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey: 7.824047687975209

hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london: 7.00515961956163

after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard: 7.703711795046523

every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr: 5.171651427644107

it was then disclosed in the following manner: 14.947556191774426

i never saw such a long chin in my life: 6.113208614506863

if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better: 11.779043927394788

it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention: 10.598414584285322

she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on: 8.132437846057488

how strange must it appear to him: 6.921030759091482

wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia: 6.826193602750786

she is a very fine looking woman: 8.148555147836092

bingley called again and alone: 7.473916874793447

but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well: 11.29770858319199

he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it: 10.574832345069954

but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king: 23.810432844445167

your s sincerely c: 6.596648727166348

i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections: 5.756266446392362

it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now: 6.289471537911276

chapter xvii: 7.147921603391787

the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment: 8.328159891357709

he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me: 8.096715150058776

long said so too for i asked her whether you did not: 8.339339917866093

you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason: 6.761298402430074

bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight: 5.694477035376961

forster: 3.5948178308507814

his debts to be discharged and something still to remain: 9.761633745726822

he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped: 8.398235548792128

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr: 6.089641184159809

she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns: 17.253824977820827

nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole: 10.722924760149997

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother: 14.109149906279086

there is one point on which i want your advice: 10.193495842508696

collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help: 7.218302613932494

recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of: 9.67282836508154

it is too long ago: 5.510981260243062

elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr: 8.906011789682754

well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him: 10.830917696442771

such amiable qualities must speak for themselves: 9.867883254336924

it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before: 12.909125103352117

when i last saw her she was not very promising: 14.76433325708699

to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures: 11.388990254523545

i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent: 8.18003640860409

if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient: 9.363050235364128

his brother in law mr: 7.603182212536093

i never heard any thing so abominable: 8.319455947761977

you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas: 13.423921630609161

he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true: 18.357074829383276

here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse: 7.627316642681067

compliments always take _you_ by surprise and _me_ never: 7.911119380070734

i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly: 9.634552542617651

darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings: 7.2768516194581

mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good: 9.770952211614992

the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room: 10.228984149621054

very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family: 7.06868551294387

i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer: 9.15167826963312

one of them does: 3.394644054140325

it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours: 7.962424333267456

let the other young ladies have time to exhibit: 8.20493456983558

i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away: 10.579417483163265

never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her: 7.1081642023014275

but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane: 9.907891400607204

upon my word: 14.862225384036579

no it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr: 13.008437116815324

bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield: 9.338486810661866

did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent: 5.20978127715608

she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it: 7.938434125863304

so imprudent a match on both sides: 7.930811919834871

elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family: 8.554980490323159

the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness: 8.733215930668699

gardiner could do: 7.558434140608501

and what sort of young lady is she: 8.65697975210209

she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject: 10.325838329113436

in a few minutes mrs: 5.531310525897769

bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer: 16.569026254758896

nothing could be more delightful: 3.618460447701537

but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs: 6.968084385237775

i do not deserve it: 8.839585785851838

i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him: 6.454517755121723

she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it: 8.577991011681728

he is so excessively handsome: 7.978092088839326

and what is fifty miles of good road: 6.460752694759223

lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master: 10.11035578335884

then pray speak aloud: 3.9276045722070565

the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl: 6.819686751969617

bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood: 6.08015528844032

he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great: 8.539401255817026

when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr: 10.565721075125055

the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr: 8.691161878610162

his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution: 7.144654429608204

at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies: 9.113369139280636

colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings: 10.10613358925126

those who do not complain are never pitied: 18.479684064419132

it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began: 7.46125645626063

why my dear you must know mrs: 8.291028200872935

are you out of your senses to be accepting this man: 4.595059227435462

a most delightful place: 13.0962900587228

no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me: 14.074137677939198

so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next: 12.196444476137778

does that young lady know mr: 10.531612275152446

they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain: 7.340325396096698

but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house: 16.415916936908953

as mrs: 10.051805711085507

elizabeth was surprised but said not a word: 14.824398465193289

i quite forgot: 10.260936094016692

long will do any such thing: 4.567987845178663

charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility: 8.126291816837204

and do you impute it to either of those: 11.692543878306251

bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters: 9.013909786116665

and so was i: 6.6554443376432735

this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then: 9.326184464697471

as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth: 11.286259551282395

in what an amiable light does this place him: 9.390547763118905

you mistake me my dear: 7.267214169445237

darcy with a very expressive smile: 6.877012956173998

though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here: 10.37681254544402

in the first place replied mr: 9.649187138107955

you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself: 14.058179781419366

it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations: 12.291369012522138

i knew you would be wishing me joy: 5.18614596639794

miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton: 7.580879295156257

the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch: 6.8548452817309835

gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs: 8.60570046570583

but will they make you happy: 6.668492540526745

her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object: 9.352351131777217

collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off: 16.654339762815166

could she have seen half as much love in mr: 10.844018517842736

a few days after this visit mr: 13.56388652004136

but depend upon it mr: 7.077347623810301

with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings: 9.696015460557806

exceed their income: 4.573236591645489

the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune: 7.338540981034165

i shall be back by dinner: 5.071342794251231

dearest jane: 9.969899159196563

what could she mean by it: 12.333659392960204

i must go instantly to my mother she cried: 5.902602920517421

she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings: 7.735125288231544

she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr: 13.089306397701545

you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it: 7.73503049199755

from the entrance hall of which mr: 8.206756339865724

i know it cannot be long: 5.5082855481754684

he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house: 13.864578778595874

all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot: 9.288311897220742

but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle: 12.432547160077545

she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together: 7.939461028374964

collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained: 9.04515433097943

observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr: 6.213076156236657

hurst and elizabeth herself: 8.358663925962066

you never see a fault in any body: 7.797152963009959

the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed: 7.989238347248916

wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps: 9.083566728333793

darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do: 13.677978013608056

gardiner could not be seen and mr: 11.891978019956394

then who taught you: 3.9276045722070565

vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled: 11.984437351140873

i will not tell you what it is: 6.795134132259708

i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place: 7.341991026803889

at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way: 10.754122048491427

may we take my uncle s letter to read to her: 5.118026539170697

bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings: 7.330655985727568

thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition: 12.793745572444841

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern: 10.531491898695622

his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others: 8.225882835227504

said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with: 8.99120875608683

the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon: 6.025165013184814

yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise: 9.139079348566739

i think i have heard you say that you know them: 11.639104350572097

conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none: 6.914817846533203

two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day: 8.106355183723359

you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty: 8.886315983603902

miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her: 13.694576151924387

chapter ii: 7.147921603391787

she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did: 9.480474522548471

tell her that you insist upon her marrying him: 22.055170372324945

she was sorry that mr: 5.738617862522914

elizabeth did not know what to make of it: 16.5566281630581

what could become of mr: 4.67847682993679

elizabeth immediately began playing again: 10.716637281256576

if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them: 7.942001247306253

chapter xv: 7.147921603391787

in short i will do my best: 14.87612578646002

as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce: 10.494308716363818

there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable: 10.800467512569057

lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr: 12.446027789820441

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic: 8.690934554885715

i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on: 6.859026986164629

elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word: 15.176243836837191

as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on: 9.468735244026224

in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh: 5.6542516402153025

how can mr: 5.853469584994172

when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr: 7.90467122489631

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance: 6.696962307356391

collins in reply to his last: 13.751030989025532

she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here: 12.091498835243728

wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character: 11.312155510828049

what do you think has happened this morning: 11.65686774843463

elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs: 6.367933321800272

gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing: 12.35410982207809

they were in street: 7.7151388404096055

really mr: 4.797141785693573

not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room: 14.928598605033281

darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance: 6.345472990537114

at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction: 13.01401313089755

they are my old friends: 5.7384500600133155

i have no such injuries to resent: 5.816273100659198

i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about mr: 9.157490285342613

as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza: 10.474491988391813

his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased: 13.446083849298478

thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me: 11.766930700256223

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose: 7.967388126160083

my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance: 9.063682314941888

i will only add god bless you: 6.951032516793142

elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room: 7.814086706401899

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs: 7.855846406672047

i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name: 5.545231958208326

ii: 4.243243607058394

he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild: 6.4589536743083915

but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded: 5.22177921692028

no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject: 8.564202330082429

but now it comes out: 9.236553606521735

if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four of the clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day: 10.912873119512847

i was uncomfortable enough: 6.960746520905405

your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you: 11.87277297384091

the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter: 8.943618648208998

bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home: 8.30879626792535

elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes: 12.100696268822276

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged: 9.624544916478634

of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance: 6.295396944217619

putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way: 7.346897001010946

such a disappointment: 12.018972063885558

he added that mr: 6.255111160552615

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him: 8.820046961282221

if elizabeth when mr: 5.814307527775378

elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view: 5.925926159893675

such doings discomposed mr: 4.4392223171299605

what do you mean mr: 11.560739354008657

many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr: 4.990277743877285

kitty run down and order the carriage: 4.99198897127277

certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger: 7.58836064347326

darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable: 13.361405283601288

maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire: 8.723259883364829

he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself: 11.547886076687274

bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all: 17.015863205848227

within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate: 10.057073290056517

yes vanity is a weakness indeed: 8.173704212202619

haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week: 7.690199242314189

collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs: 10.124668236768667

but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr: 10.398299040720953

with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it: 7.832619637146518

but he is a liberal master i suppose and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue: 7.512811496107433

why should they try to influence him: 9.300264808814974

bingley does not know mr: 12.025748257324627

if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it: 17.89634228306997

will you hear it: 13.55862957406287

it was unpardonable: 5.569348069044251

do clear _them_ too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody: 6.989892255844824

they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either: 6.346732413837206

do you really think so: 7.910079868194597

had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage: 12.679932032429319

the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion: 22.28768308204873

collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st: 14.445737766216277

jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day: 10.858309993914427

it is because he will not give himself the trouble: 6.063620501177206

i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat: 14.252043304664749

darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy: 13.371289819120724

she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all: 5.370420442682505

miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room: 8.116162343761935

we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is: 8.611699917002088

but it was not to be: 2.1800731302209404

but my dear lydia i do not at all like your going such a way off: 11.280684606143398

certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions: 6.712357605601985

this will not do said elizabeth: 8.536184501387906

darcy was here when you sent for us was it so: 7.987712394901857

that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well: 13.222452897459233

it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them: 9.69555321365417

elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it: 7.084186463455622

i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match cried elizabeth: 5.2370816654296775

no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it: 8.737996352511978

indeed mr: 3.0225131749746095

do not imagine me ignorant of their condition: 12.627224870459118

for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody: 8.802327900672779

i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject: 4.609349721736548

heaven and earth: 4.573236591645489

collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr: 11.168050666332462

elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes: 12.488436339428898

darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her: 24.26430750175408

how could you begin: 17.72816544014858

elizabeth coloured and said a little: 13.561378484260354

they will have nothing else to do: 13.11010817689181

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr: 9.793962192019755

this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place: 13.05853526447081

or had you intended any more serious consequence: 6.026023880923962

before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs: 6.063491785803671

_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all: 8.914844759175322

poor charlotte: 4.236105288769432

darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right: 16.33296101349142

every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression: 9.638211403739824

she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr: 7.985964179463043

gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday: 11.4940794408525

darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too _little_ she might have fancied too _much_: 10.14608497551131

_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle mr: 7.751877843210846

wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr: 9.46721425032448

that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr: 7.757397266962761

he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself: 13.052114382922548

but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both: 10.66178272193782

beyond a doubt they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing: 8.014187381460262

darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song: 6.521911423216251

and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty: 12.6134629602573

you may depend upon my not mentioning it: 13.68509791078928

their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection: 6.4923077058406715

to yield readily easily to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you: 11.894405533884653

wickham s being among them: 7.513885964782

said she: 10.222482990298909

let us hope for better things: 5.619912353279883

bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening: 5.922665663099519

is it not clear enough: 3.905780296097971

more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr: 9.155604134734201

i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with: 8.000474158661858

collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go: 7.827743498070395

collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl: 8.576827154398208

it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife: 12.513172669061078

i have said no such thing: 5.9372454264997385

bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him: 8.904299665197819

jenkinson s room: 6.294374988537395

the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation: 8.659026729483333

i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting: 9.209255369284904

chapter i: 7.147921603391787

i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude: 5.919850505675226

every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane: 10.17244624740172

i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all: 11.29600846644637

on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects: 10.900644902053376

he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable: 7.701848372154983

it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded: 8.65544467313593

cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable: 6.08367412464

the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men: 7.687167917830934

she shook her head: 14.610112077855618

can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it: 8.846555828857761

not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it: 8.96362828018406

darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it: 9.484799748479682

i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly: 6.946180599527561

elizabeth was distressed: 8.661241555576394

end of vol: 4.050363783737175

we will go round the park every day: 12.958865922848062

miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr: 11.961611313969765

lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance: 9.225515716291326

colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object: 7.393149138666328

but of every other neglect i can believe him capable: 6.460605638332687

i do not know who is good enough for him: 9.63842898761137

my good kind brother: 7.026654493055847

and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner: 7.225570718674839

bennet are not they: 6.89718034500679

how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt: 13.715444950290959

gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr: 7.767113851486039

not one: 23.959476468591234

it would have been strange if they had: 7.575161547991689

you know i have: 9.809388309075585

i see the imprudence of it: 11.348491897973908

darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr: 13.02562322393807

he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits: 12.004568001310423

how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other: 13.543880511429355

they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade: 13.35245204695631

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs: 15.99189710862315

colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon: 5.666502478874485

on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor: 12.874448239541303

when this was done she had a less active part to play: 13.680447590225382

well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next: 11.226494051034154

they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine: 11.994605899595681

it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas: 11.023456895471199

but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness: 14.286210128448912

but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem: 7.8124906441819215

yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside: 12.159592407325711

oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened: 8.499068606526269

and i have another favour to ask: 5.8426948983395235

_you_ wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body: 6.426105334426511

darcy made no answer: 9.313932353730795

long has just been here and she told me all about it: 8.482691104974055

the latter was thinking only of his breakfast: 8.557784048005127

so handsome: 5.255610217846075

he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things: 9.039285098715807

bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable: 8.388532787905115

with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning: 8.16897036410521

it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week: 4.9221353264788945

it was all pride and insolence: 7.400186306229233

can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties: 8.225046845599605

besides there was truth in his looks: 8.146927523008323

was not this some excuse for incivility if i _was_ uncivil: 11.766930700256223

but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate: 8.196629938045822

i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_: 7.891857273746487

the comfort to _her_ of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression: 9.244493445558575

i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe: 10.363518976157149

when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that _i_ might have prevented it: 9.067228436140095

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs: 5.874129180208158

do not keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake: 11.83969436503027

soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately: 13.209567034491766

gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever: 7.5450778664845375

there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again: 10.903051645197909

as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not _know_ of any prepossession her _eldest_ daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged: 12.004537562334146

i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books: 9.490552209055048

bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter: 10.811490271772636

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr: 6.047429253718048

i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow: 7.741803572852765

her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined: 9.5887319317061

no she would go home: 13.125426063566794

it is well: 10.192534408300835

bennet and the children: 8.134627466155722

a: 11.421733729267672

when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her: 10.08039570908528

when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so: 7.681591358962885

easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important: 8.8490739757089

darcy speaking to her: 7.897088272590985

gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well: 8.508274519819848

i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal: 6.779715994195689

it is evident that you belong to the first circles: 10.387431415084794

jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare: 9.822325048794896

when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least: 7.548992096328264

accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me: 7.824461719802057

you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage: 10.598082565281732

it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth: 6.191326933863108

i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them: 13.59775403652327

we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago: 9.214140256728104

your idea of the ponies is delightful: 11.604027114761875

lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer: 13.211813549166282

wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry: 8.76802481195442

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy: 7.017922768849535

i shall go distracted: 10.276140733676563

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste: 10.495492716014134

collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure: 8.354628865924862

collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent: 10.67384724133579

this was agreed to and mrs: 9.639180532150903

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr: 8.019701729555253

her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter: 7.342501204802688

darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable: 8.628956480439156

darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me: 9.271334718413685

it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to: 12.443656001279582

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity: 5.919559200593522

miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth: 11.58824109521273

wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented: 7.16801619205144

you shall have it in few words: 12.931563328856443

miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard: 15.082455481527143

even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr: 11.442409558529913

i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things: 9.24848355082714

darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him: 7.940416853237965

her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home: 8.65465422768134

the first part of mrs: 18.678061106576774

international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states: 6.814236931840617

darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak: 10.967501065350168

that his two sisters and mr: 13.653583352383245

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour: 13.53375925428539

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs: 10.450212459001996

for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter: 8.86575325225652

they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited: 8.749847777257495

i do not wish to avoid the walk: 17.828091740648947

repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed: 10.04547710106483

gardiner but perhaps to the lakes: 16.258396487639345

besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight: 14.20589730421282

he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book: 8.532971982090507

i certainly saw mr: 14.754971806517158

perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often: 12.726597984626197

i am sure my sisters must all envy me: 7.537973658537538

darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner: 12.281320518701092

the officers will find women better worth their notice: 8.871741640859732

does he know his real character: 10.627103330401194

darcy had walked away to another part of the room: 4.511880106699401

no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical: 11.017625776067907

cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves: 2.5494676313890126

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment: 15.315450634909078

if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents: 7.3215153101491595

as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable: 8.353612536135845

after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr: 8.710739862625513

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr: 7.891795058010998

money: 4.243243607058394

you dislike an argument and want to silence this: 7.050177175399667

but enough of this: 4.767441782713678

pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive: 6.402945769598172

i always said it must be so at last: 11.452272575099856

what is he coming home and without poor lydia: 11.59989008704574

but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede: 9.796053952516017

miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty: 12.944873020997157

but why all this secrecy: 5.575686903983583

collins were once silent: 11.739171980785377

elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply: 7.988553423539107

it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in: 9.58351063968315

her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie: 12.064055177867267

she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr: 7.674225305586358

do you know mr: 8.086084826585749

i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return: 8.441359105128187

by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration: 11.637315117873571

darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea: 10.3594388409046

wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them is less certain: 10.00656942141394

we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield: 8.260374716288489

this is the estimation in which you hold me: 8.578684826823244

this cannot be: 25.577265353278452

she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her: 15.162261389158786

her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them: 10.563020720137574

darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet: 21.50152509754933

he has not an ill natured look: 5.221937362415024

bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family: 9.003994863605953

elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her: 9.166427933412074

royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section <NUM> information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation: 5.289190825180032

and what did she say: 6.204529294775147

darcy then was: 6.649573983120321

elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself: 7.318888016487659

her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much: 8.571695560262121

here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown: 5.5087505768772616

you can _now_ have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered: 12.582733841821355

my dearest sister now _be_ be serious: 9.682365876116952

at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself: 12.539890617511572

elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation: 5.184019375580592

but think no more of the letter: 19.697927367517163

he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible: 7.520798625333378

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes: 7.815061447474071

it became her turn to listen: 6.82793753050623

if he no longer cares for me why silent: 6.935716762084916

charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth: 7.008722270110299

i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading: 8.864389030932285

your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land: 8.340262091149812

in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings: 11.195232442366898

it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment: 8.740000767189777

and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman: 16.888518625981874

what is there of good to be expected: 16.36435580575796

can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him: 5.362695819299404

the girls stared at their father: 9.731921503854187

say that urgent business calls us home immediately: 5.9826667937042535

collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs: 7.676569748861804

oh lord: 6.649712103772388

he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy: 8.391075377151855

my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr: 12.782515834043368

to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add: 12.722042268854834

implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character: 8.016376379594796

his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling: 7.389017212967848

it is a pity they are not handsome: 5.706791291476904

the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained: 9.658494270720714

chapter xxiii: 9.682865003888603

lord: 3.4658936678952847

you deserve no such attention: 10.813229334125163

she is a great deal too ill to be moved: 8.176482148785647

i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure: 11.28068310143223

yet it did and even a third: 10.670640189522528

he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn: 13.679190152019451

but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere: 14.06049999137253

if he does not come to me _then_ said she i shall give him up for ever: 13.351316578768728

by this time she is actually with them: 6.398112629143058

from the former: 10.527480024562799

was not a man to be trusted: 20.10022995551231

jenkinson were sitting: 3.5057911779728497

_ dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance: 9.627884978078384

bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else: 7.742636452480042

bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr: 8.34318076412405

but the wife of mr: 3.206708103155423

there was no help for it however: 9.329550689138495

bennet came from it: 6.233474919619611

anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr: 5.332990753010727

of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity: 8.739720759629138

hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of: 12.97887401665311

she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it: 11.921712596651707

bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn: 7.193327511894695

it would have suited me in every respect: 9.260126099922237

but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation: 7.238945235730903

bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure: 12.027067152439555

pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night: 7.3172455849853115

wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as _they_ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room: 8.572070367473627

conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible: 6.658628367097602

who attended to you: 2.844384935531778

i have by no means done: 5.110413285020729

i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs: 4.465384401083725

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers: 8.498895408262797

the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be: 6.88973719970113

lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way: 9.62310328154016

bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome: 7.1817399238144795

gardiner s long letter but now having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write: 7.415313402107618

it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace: 16.99682770310286

do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm: 8.091708813736542

but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them: 6.581453970164145

well how pleased i am: 6.891651994905777

she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him: 10.944035240129748

his disposition must be dreadful: 18.93539970616217

elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father: 6.976726049234366

when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr: 11.067498163305066

he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand: 10.601911204102143

i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud _i_ have seen nothing of it: 7.246680405014587

are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet: 7.685175127881528

bennet by admiring mrs: 11.232516256911302

you know nothing of the matter: 3.3034313905360935

in the intervals of her discourse with mrs: 7.435588288852933

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth: 9.462842169333083

secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness: 7.61348005748468

copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change: 6.239701547943315

from what we have seen of him continued mrs: 18.495699095224094

their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush: 6.818135400123542

she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr: 6.029906488518805

at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr: 9.53804904306645

after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud: 6.588607066883198

he was well but so much engaged with mr: 10.532147318046345

we can all _begin_ freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement: 13.918056954381038

yes very different: 9.15462461425602

so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper or _her_ affectionate heart: 6.363301020596604

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view: 9.780226879041452

bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself: 7.738203555653881

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham _i_ can hardly be just to him: 5.514803778705703

my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it: 13.260021658862366

they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them: 12.553915788740506

and for _this_ we are to be thankful: 22.918185127050076

she could have added a young man too like _you_ whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner: 7.927922683833864

at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr: 12.370318473029199

it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill: 6.066067498157498

there is not a bit of fish to be got to day: 17.836659448704307

what are men to rocks and mountains: 10.8667845623082

bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr: 9.219814528760912

you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him: 7.320154773394029

his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again: 8.65398242550867

there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works: 6.571902831341045

it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning: 10.788091693052738

i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children: 10.289854940326771

_their_ situation was awkward enough but _her s_ she thought was still worse: 6.283601736508756

i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs: 8.740524014367955

as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness: 6.908239644696936

but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there: 9.118477641307502

here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery: 8.343772843172978

and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together: 10.776772778309716

but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle: 8.36095371563486

it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining: 7.268546941602191

she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before: 8.286023519478828

she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners: 8.252067263861848

collins was wishing to marry you: 6.142750661743323

however i recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr: 7.423148635458697

the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them: 9.139143087605664

society i own is necessary to me: 6.570033661904566

i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles: 9.896803427283755

my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us: 16.08922688152774

her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense: 12.612670984966803

and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection: 12.328427508759665

but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them: 10.738609742132603

she was at least free from the offence of mr: 5.316754050507166

his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars: 13.484347614281535

bennet s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library: 12.310198965861925

_they_ will take care not to outrun their income: 9.243408820141081

had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind: 7.995326083515482

the envelope itself was likewise full: 9.731921503854187

i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage: 10.822419143045321

gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again: 10.825800171935763

but i will no longer importune my young cousin: 10.542638270626686

its completion depended on others: 12.19298696542636

that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_: 8.938281385746887

had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr: 9.590195219309166

to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal: 9.378124305226198

bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable: 7.145412432254712

bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before: 8.347497254874604

and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me: 15.229769387928062

it may do very well for the others replied mr: 11.311077964184857

in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself: 9.05113849478043

her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world: 7.852410098630158

the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence: 10.744847160373679

they found mr: 14.070572013742256

cried wickham with a look which did not escape her: 8.078241472574563

now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits: 9.485776526205235

but it is always so: 3.814059680069218

no indeed: 21.1870858100389

your s very sincerely m: 6.643495405615216

the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished: 12.129372560308335

after tea mr: 10.00031371859349

yes very well: 12.650935226283574

but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me: 12.20189488271263

_he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain: 7.935979054689004

he was full of joy and attention: 6.893766879054529

let her go then: 8.53426432399469

but these things happen so often: 8.910985788059707

well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say: 27.379213659880673

it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could _feel_ gratitude i would now thank you: 6.731469533112517

she has two nieces of her own: 10.02815433223346

the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt: 6.7930613170735334

with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many: 7.230216950353478

i speak feelingly: 5.715054997780767

elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame: 7.675885600230853

lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern: 9.06140408558269

darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr: 7.772665223244661

nonsense how can you talk so: 13.563357676483859

it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess: 6.927534213170483

she did indeed louisa: 10.787111769478113

their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp: 7.365739533789309

there was another reason too for her opposition: 10.991119260545592

you may imagine what i felt and how i acted: 13.237759151571318

the particulars i reserve till we meet: 9.371843143938563

the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger: 13.831478911221337

darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room: 7.754727312327231

my dear continued mrs: 21.748146827589306

these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed: 7.60150468251659

wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr: 8.098018583067342

no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else: 17.632943201048413

but i must write no more: 20.040190987673448

she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend: 6.601527812858362

oh that i knew how it was: 14.06071696236819

the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike: 7.985462503482748

he was very fond of them: 8.167746453530288

he is perfectly amiable: 8.167255938673213

_you_ go to brighton: 30.45793565888986

you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it: 8.62427696888941

nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth: 7.207818774589597

i will take care of myself and of mr: 4.025072941921953

would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress: 10.648935147367412

in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on: 8.617534010095962

our poor mother is sadly grieved: 6.526179334938408

hurst and mr: 5.891551900811173

she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange: 12.156636595300716

as often as i can: 17.948177393443295

ah: 2.8309519861585732

his attachment to rosings certainly increases: 10.737658267883125

she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr: 10.994959269349915

jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth: 7.537312411719961

upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself: 10.680430898429654

they were ignorant idle and vain: 10.73126585527969

all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry: 4.529657153055785

he has always something to say to every body: 11.532703118173707

her reflections were in general satisfactory: 7.822930995975447

yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance: 8.645415120956482

collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten: 8.775883778312723

bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you: 6.135442726346932

can it be really so: 5.932740590845767

colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out: 8.267878530648247

in <NUM> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations: 6.299992941915426

your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters: 9.066910835654145

my dear hill have you heard the good news: 13.018241279038145

nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery: 8.916025583517124

jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever: 10.107414998392375

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys: 12.10473383441099

she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr: 7.199956267962216

and then we were so merry all the way home: 7.397773684255742

bingley if he _had been_ imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public: 9.697504021397982

you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <NUM>: 8.814025897374885

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed: 9.263496158192353

you take delight in vexing me: 10.22858426837661

as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring: 14.670183570512817

who would have thought she could be so thin and small: 6.220356495608805

darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her: 10.949451220312335

to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs: 13.046961264576424

she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him: 13.066805994616637

his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing: 9.183477109016124

it was gratitude: 5.569348069044251

i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful: 8.75733901478474

forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home: 7.896918320159817

this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much: 8.673533782494717

bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane: 6.184549924859269

her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr: 10.395442848941164

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short: 7.672161824721024

how rich and how great you will be: 5.994597454720007

yours c: 17.802743240757806

i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady: 34.44230955535737

yes: 28.5321297650307

and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married: 10.354484559117004

i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it: 8.060049861081861

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself: 9.571233760863539

she really looked almost wild: 6.5984081290641745

elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly: 6.545026170812193

and this is always the way with him she added: 13.499105075149611

b: 4.243243607058394

darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away: 9.10538652360937

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands: 11.623931272974614

repeated elizabeth in utter amazement: 5.675071787847375

her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered: 12.236688772783532

yes or i will never see her again: 7.73343450896364

his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing: 8.708842709041804

bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could: 9.748977431646848

do you suppose them to be in london: 17.2506790393722

i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference: 8.978419830815938

bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his: 8.022007702887096

many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing: 10.309092076755032

her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr: 9.192554195365355

she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teazing than usual to himself: 5.903457149066316

having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so: 8.777183864595518

if your master would marry you might see more of him: 7.639747274740508

her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it: 7.162658605399007

darcy had been staying there: 12.609866087340153

her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable: 11.721130439994079

bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits: 8.537852862940415

he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds: 10.157080934336323

if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is derived from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges: 10.18008307008556

darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself: 10.978694590143908

that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr: 25.4338993445414

but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity: 7.4689001281704765

since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head: 11.983051254488304

bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice: 8.353715093393072

she dared not relate the other half of mr: 6.164117130499301

intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done: 12.220460277920562

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence: 7.654107415956468

collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you: 9.79917865914571

he has heartily forgiven me now: 7.839100000640284

hate you: 4.797141785693573

i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine: 6.953488289300633

wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece: 7.199528761209922

but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her: 13.270544339263614

she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise: 9.20788427584206

darcy might have done as well: 9.914114902459664

with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr: 8.37993552243574

you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself: 8.509219726756609

i dare say i shall soon see them here: 14.047627349494881

jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it: 10.296217345827142

how unlucky: 18.922343344363977

bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt: 10.12061926524984

not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement: 12.234821252130795

the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them: 11.788664521821687

elizabeth replied that it was: 9.083706242837236

cried miss bingley: 3.784911328466337

this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs: 19.7571249282997

bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man: 12.961737417506384

its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn: 8.64260825508194

i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge: 9.068529771560076

the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly: 6.786453192030125

bennet said only nonsense nonsense: 6.328733425383426

his character is thereby complete: 7.525153294808456

the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point: 18.554485823319602

but you how are you: 7.639316581523708

go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks: 9.441008460922184

it was hardly enough but it pleased her: 6.213271648564113

send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly: 5.504044747548941

were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain: 15.693440752541306

if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon: 8.142836147359771

elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her: 6.187347436438606

you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income: 8.541672011675098

and _that_ is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr: 8.982692251599078

darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr: 6.143524917524944

his father was an excellent man said mrs: 12.421295146915995

yes _that_ is what makes it amusing: 8.025374281381293

said he as he joined her: 4.310969530319608

but no such recollection befriended her: 18.941886181027698

elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express: 6.624795135410864

excuse me for i must speak plainly: 11.277101829215228

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her: 15.880654809606531

my dear charlotte impossible: 13.515854386899255

_i_ never saw such a woman: 8.08353012119777

i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind: 9.88469076547302

when is your next ball to be lizzy: 13.984792492561821

collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy: 6.2031780018026454

human nature is so prone to fall into it: 7.963222991336232

they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family: 9.438273940421881

bennet began repeating her thanks to mr: 9.908571337591772

i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable: 8.936531949379143

as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr: 8.601239871565832

it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection: 12.518568951020105

collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn: 7.114866708058808

_that_ is a failing indeed: 9.246782340188137

darcy she moved again towards the gate: 5.4624371517219945

but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out: 13.178132583262656

her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way: 8.765910687564938

the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with mrs: 9.63760603081471

she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr: 7.169154486661114

in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man: 12.85478348642298

and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses: 10.025727196786306

he drew a chair near her: 6.926544671891051

mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day: 13.96435127583563

to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment: 11.323314663560643

this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr: 8.300361988740342

and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also: 8.39311394376765

she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours: 6.561458985141026

project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify do copyright research on transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg tm collection: 7.168800971623663

i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit: 5.782179650225083

very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same: 7.806014486369177

is there nothing you could take to give you present relief: 6.716446138713288

he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening: 12.615255161484182

bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again: 13.221159050209723

well then supposing them to be in london: 22.56021333583195

shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her: 7.441844168855171

i cannot believe it: 11.723233054315223

she practises very constantly: 6.544447422229617

the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this: 9.766276823950427

then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind: 6.370774664824899

see <NUM> h: 8.21089008380758

here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind: 7.677320559454567

it is nearly fifty miles: 6.010255877053237

it was really a very handsome thought: 22.534887036135025

this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend: 9.56114436928959

she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther: 5.868873695548806

the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do: 9.017735326350508

her ease and good spirits increased: 11.277779649736564

darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find: 8.164519198428412

my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due: 7.936588027317182

those who chose to be idle certainly might: 18.479684064419132

elizabeth on her side had much to do: 8.678162810071715

collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear: 11.508387480947485

as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all mr: 11.898020737320529

i shall see her again: 10.260450176569254

and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice: 11.269715312810966

elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph: 7.775689460019685

it is done however and it was done for the best: 12.011163819897392

brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton: 8.10538865943429

darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home: 8.159838845004296

but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person: 8.732151740809247

they met several times for there was much to be discussed: 14.2760759131006

bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn: 9.869177507045926

i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak: 12.11399032874362

reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old: 6.500689726343731

elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not: 10.161655390976584

as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship: 10.004632939287099

at night she opened her heart to jane: 10.436848298592366

i am sure you must feel it so: 11.268236553388766

but good lord: 11.697930768487737

from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs: 12.852367707771323

and what can _he_ have to say: 6.635703665188703

you shall hear what she says: 41.885642907256404

upon my word said mrs: 6.627607626991937

we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off: 6.870712914717416

darcy has never seen the view: 6.815218767886984

we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall: 8.133318725964624

how can they suit each other: 5.483678348390256

she repeated: 6.359036433307482

it had better have happened to _you_ lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner: 6.347174143309894

but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me: 8.210834256286493

miss bennet i am shocked and astonished: 5.84395225665439

miss bennet i insist on being satisfied: 6.251739924765838

while sir william was with them mr: 7.428284232055691

she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs: 8.868804553825868

had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr: 8.620092805784344

i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer: 8.098338296572889

it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first: 6.421461154175896

collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr: 9.737883860529399

that tall proud man: 8.804103469634686

no one but mrs: 20.254805179101012

nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece: 6.697299238626602

then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet: 5.332990753010727

pray how _violent was_ mr: 5.231486824547865

it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture: 5.590049088870365

those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs: 8.764589877453178

gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn: 10.092469820326619

collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton: 10.14579826490956

i dare say you will find him very agreeable: 19.368734852291617

it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush: 7.487826175822551

the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence: 8.58717709576696

i am sorry to say it of them but so it is: 15.998588358053302

i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it: 6.214285884099156

i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i _should_ be looked at: 6.941332068967636

the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty: 10.422588244516959

such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them: 9.647982492058452

must it be so: 14.383947584613848

lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room: 25.693617836991884

if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence: 9.457003947155572

bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high: 9.623123623402126

not all that mrs: 12.740699104896859

anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn: 5.759176472760743

but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves: 6.58747057435002

where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil: 7.72260354632247

but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising: 6.710727813236814

reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends: 8.799767638066578

gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends: 10.373570999361887

i guessed as much: 5.901871264579445

it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind: 8.279424292038952

egerton military library whitehall: 62.12902146975526

the part which i acted is now to be explained: 8.691161878610162

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr: 11.067194331756237

but i confess they would have no charms for _me_: 8.95060475705509

she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour: 11.514577609705025

his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire: 11.991357670471494

it seems an hopeless business: 6.247269721860767

i do not remember her name among the ladies at court: 7.901244255553676

the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s: 7.7447495016757

bingley s heart were entertained: 5.667986258480966

unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg <NUM>: 9.549923337284474

if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen: 9.543942757540021

darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner: 8.91716026421749

by mrs: 1.822067214064814

how near it may be to _mine_ i cannot pretend to say: 14.60396507471293

charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard: 7.684288243794683

amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life: 6.771769605171908

good girl: 3.708792627759515

there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care: 10.004043787749422

at length she spoke again: 6.772323282631215

perhaps that is not possible for any one: 5.382582959947907

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother: 6.9104446144347325

during dinner mr: 9.270856887477182

oh jane take care: 13.44318600577994

philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr: 8.313260186252595

but however that shall not prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined: 15.145723023242534

the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him: 15.48484747804853

the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter: 10.059559430009125

collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs: 7.50566362559402

i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law: 9.836327255031177

do you prefer reading to cards: 9.055758841172862

darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way: 9.6590023259805

she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success: 7.111546691884653

i want to talk very seriously: 11.221135408522473

i had not believed it possible: 6.981204304838719

at present we have nothing to guide us: 11.732766609903273

she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield: 7.452500857187533

not that i am afraid of _myself_ but i dread other people s remarks: 18.37818883780734

lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour: 12.161090553737468

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love: 10.88317473032194

and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body: 7.122382929757516

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement: 6.581081351905454

bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c: 11.69803967005623

we passed each other several times: 4.71361977266926

if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however: 10.295345587173802

your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth: 11.070706483181995

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs: 9.232787657416923

limited warranty disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph <NUM>: 8.668533442776594

and what is your success: 5.748107202081657

her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family: 8.1439659435565

she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs: 9.428260572107172

his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself: 8.245046871174912

when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister: 6.238947577619882

on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid: 10.585063272663005

you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken: 6.551722618773543

but what does he say of the living: 11.437396649302755

you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice: 7.55027837929905

james s: 150.26455716392346

philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs: 7.687169078388444

on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion: 8.480714487335442

_that_ will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on _me_: 6.774293527617706

do not you darcy: 7.717212062962285

thoughtless thoughtless lydia: 9.270856887477182

her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating: 9.5887319317061

and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs: 11.247996638653419

and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did: 9.677237360808988

how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family: 8.234213554674124

he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty: 7.490323604130704

what will you think of my vanity: 13.143657059100107

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr: 9.679553661766603

replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before: 7.285675550755258

indeed he has no improper pride: 5.32738778667812

does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly: 12.42067443926893

oh lizzy: 38.908399039990044

bingley and jane: 15.478614753318809

miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps: 9.297020770121161

your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage: 10.779334645324555

collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours: 8.935277573761306

that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare: 11.327582403174377

cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment: 4.086171829058708

it is more than i engage for i assure you: 5.501037500615329

but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief: 11.736725985692681

after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr: 11.9478696697516

how he must have felt it: 7.36368989494767

yes very handsome: 9.15462461425602

on saturday he came again: 13.803536330039591

but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money: 14.654785521784667

his reception however was of the most flattering kind: 6.472462022646752

to pemberley therefore they were to go: 11.335748501490922

bennet for any thing about the entail: 12.473567977306228

my dear aunt how could you think of it: 9.79242589914963

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs: 9.095803740927142

he should be particularly happy at any time c: 6.20394288121809

teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind: 14.497085540095728

she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk: 9.140996159473325

kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon: 7.247297139064833

it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts: 9.928958970304206

darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words: 10.854916265840787

collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him: 11.771435943847761

but the case is this: 5.0292932453188905

he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived: 8.203936536561278

i grieve to find however that colonel f: 5.9232975431936765

while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family: 7.594889005632931

as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too: 7.986023841364912

you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing: 9.725560757507349

he bore it however with admirable calmness: 12.406955218963605

it did: 6.725781521469756

had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort: 6.753558260318348

bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly: 8.517680535004096

chapter xiv: 7.147921603391787

elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it: 12.929881309352293

they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other: 6.7422669244457945

he keeps a man servant does he: 6.927111207239129

darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner: 13.256706474966519

they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight: 8.447860243935548

do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense: 7.757391354755915

i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers: 12.962461490723829

denny comes back from town: 8.620231093224103

your sister i also watched: 12.201118219893136

i promised them so faithfully: 6.039038752423456

she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess: 7.940357876460089

we can all plague and punish one another: 9.14150015008943

my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise: 8.98762873108332

he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said: 15.171329409848049

darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost: 11.714035140079314

darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came: 11.24830274109351

they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life: 8.748788412833742

darcy mentioned his letter: 6.0514512668250715

he made no answer: 5.3455871314829215

i cannot blame myself for having done thus much: 5.423186930873373

she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations: 13.898712427982412

darcy after enquiring of her how mr: 6.331672854617449

how abominable: 9.104722373922607

she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr: 13.329767616039668

as long as she stays there it is all very well: 7.2372150197801455

he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st: 8.190102789709577

that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling: 9.571049110422717

gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr: 6.903256584802703

my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken: 10.419971987398572

the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly: 10.499915448205082

the path just admitted three: 6.725162796746272

how good it was in you my dear mr: 8.341929784454532

i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel: 8.161172162951372

nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister: 5.886310501901056

the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door: 9.886902420777533

i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him: 9.255818120282294

a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation: 8.746335591307256

i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not: 6.417564509200621

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt: 12.60013369457903

darcy returned within the stated time: 6.753979838362806

such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth: 6.200889118967708

what is it you are talking of: 9.471690432080123

i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness: 8.92341973011752

she will be married at sixteen: 14.340706168032845

and i certainly _never_ shall give it: 9.948523598636292

it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard: 9.366569900020512

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate: 8.220185762417223

the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten: 8.91619862662436

that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr: 8.594955287252926

i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly: 6.8823183269439365

if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once: 12.662705393351112

it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast: 6.4545302735044645

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together: 10.518214768075767

mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library: 8.283780868022953

i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun: 7.990238460286825

and now here s mr: 16.582922939307945

they walked on without knowing in what direction: 13.232969824901414

if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law: 12.397910392270948

all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again: 8.9625160475469

darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true: 6.53744905262079

he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security: 6.928730135007033

having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report: 8.762584484822845

jane was so admired nothing could be like it: 7.0763501284439645

you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you: 9.952958293595437

they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr: 9.102312734030868

those were your words: 13.396429843601641

he could not speak a word for full ten minutes: 10.032394364777888

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr: 4.333396040240142

he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty: 11.650528490440312

you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness: 6.78236067028777

i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression: 13.074723391169504

she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous: 8.754715091332205

darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property: 11.460108342123272

lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone: 8.511222233224835

its business office is located at <NUM> north <NUM> west salt lake city ut <NUM> <PHONENO>: 14.061318545436789

his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear: 8.754044006710563

i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly: 9.305917093934982

_that_ is all to be forgot: 12.858800287803081

elizabeth silently attended her: 7.076036959731536

you have done all this: 13.123064278177111

how wonderfully these sort of things occur: 10.83117813286487

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject: 8.9004213128864

our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast: 6.790873513417335

bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent: 8.81535084209217

we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured: 5.725371068162231

darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it: 6.382960468290208

i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter: 8.939520729166894

darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again: 6.925501809842172

every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight: 7.491179980833518

he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning: 8.478253587357495

darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr: 12.54100424265473

i had much rather go in the coach: 7.160557422257782

she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs: 7.364107605609749

elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it: 14.244884193973645

but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for: 13.297244485624987

i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr: 9.557899044209712

darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only: 10.45513115785683

but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came: 11.353148419025125

with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations: 12.930924002256326

but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune: 9.158937803475043

she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost: 9.879984731430708

she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr: 11.360784815863257

collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr: 5.886651034029501

the next was in these words: 14.15704928879965

i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows: 5.579890329282161

though her manner varied however her determination never did: 6.634348367754619

they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it: 7.063305339387894

thank god: 18.62367781589759

htm or <NUM> h: 8.832275715885476

it was dated from rosings at eight of the clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you: 9.152149999186575

make haste make haste: 14.38394758461384

with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected: 6.017878444402155

i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr: 6.349480332026144

such very superior dancing is not often seen: 5.305406511047172

darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself: 9.923251806335262

i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr: 6.943075739287699

and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth: 11.869046356177462

hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out: 11.060335381842776

collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman: 10.729556978744036

we seem to have been designed for each other: 6.484833093857154

he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister: 10.822562312482006

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been: 8.30408277879891

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet: 12.8852374916276

collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them: 8.091680768384848

all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading: 8.54491694344737

any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr: 10.035253118522268

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once: 8.85612727038353

but do not imagine that he is always here so often: 22.72717984769909

elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight: 9.914838932598883

and my mother how is she: 9.560879794866374

bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter: 8.193868582002528

nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true: 10.156403502587969

they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it: 7.761822801589676

she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter: 9.597287186017375

it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country: 12.320042255841797

and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it: 9.462780490946054

but the gentlemen will have mr: 4.852517444085851

in understanding darcy was the superior: 7.874778030343466

not that i _shall_ though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out: 12.334248332315985

she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself: 7.810963345744442

there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr: 7.272673879346139

the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news: 8.432888280420764

darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house: 8.129290839314374

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her: 12.592424420822198

but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name: 6.477518335829822

she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again: 12.123473239837834

whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure: 10.653302091390128

are you much acquainted with mr: 4.408940894356043

you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him: 7.181128494971418

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned: 7.555677364203585

but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment: 8.341897754070692

but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years: 8.555549443731485

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr: 7.681359880574999

that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny: 10.298279777730963

but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent: 7.643604573557977

she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation: 6.426673575477989

and is it really true: 6.590251018238481

another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away: 9.631746662085964

you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works provided that you pay a royalty fee of <NUM> of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes: 8.17072611402166

this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret: 9.659770791692726

_you_ were mr: 4.674559168733217

collins then returned to elizabeth: 6.572642504170912

but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other: 12.942455842305941

i had often seen him in love before: 13.660865636333936

will you do me the honour of reading that letter: 9.994005642390338

charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time: 9.496119198381038

darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend: 10.132955903282348

darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life: 7.985496554536696

his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad: 15.232709591894295

she was overpowered by shame and vexation: 8.28696324820337

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives: 9.348796473970674

poor dear child: 4.674559168733217

i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding: 8.719403953126807

however little mr: 12.811558629392286

the officer was the very mr: 6.7506329035857044

as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents: 6.718093219361605

were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me: 9.767127184462913

give me farther particulars: 8.832275715885471

elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away: 7.291616234798834

i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you: 7.835511578110852

bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it: 6.8520201274089825

yes i understand you perfectly: 18.16618780718037

this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree: 15.813555901311991

his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion: 5.991010669503823

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr: 6.997943245627887

collins s conversation to herself: 4.242945620606456

it is of all subjects my delight: 8.58740216638499

if mr: 7.423793259787492

of a fine stout healthy love it may: 6.205132403161671

bingley in consequence of it before _they_ did: 6.876538229354888

neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight: 9.485088347850121

at length however mrs: 16.663894390752723

bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife: 9.863804284553225

it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt: 9.885066202849522

if this be the case he deserves you: 10.217303116005759

yes she called yesterday with her father: 7.562328406509399

on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities: 8.88128250518481

she did indeed: 11.78471135929638

darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love: 7.497871508598793

let me hear from you very soon: 6.002548331346697

darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way: 7.6628217368632265

you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased: 9.525140721079865

i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible: 7.86963020098597

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within: 10.16004795910212

there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be: 5.391990327162856

it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy: 10.68317870713358

in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before: 11.873966706866385

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now: 10.498375228698226

collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man: 16.174830693070756

i am all astonishment: 5.498222863807654

how could he spare half ten thousand pounds: 12.882467276759193

they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride: 11.383082644983007

bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only: 9.989343275358985

he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business: 7.081240169470521

seriously i would have you be on your guard: 17.572304230330765

darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr: 14.295934100661606

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs: 9.075683719764518

you are too hasty sir she cried: 5.799347267754487

i saw them the night before last: 6.2269005394042365

from mr: 2.2857223264085453

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth: 7.5756247741547345

their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s: 7.02732515423084

how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him: 6.018935439953911

collins and mr: 3.3488569458322646

imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_: 6.189428463051814

elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him: 7.443285460935678

aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to: 8.214221980776928

in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room: 6.338420039825366

but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err: 7.762501322405207

can he be a sensible man sir: 4.436798462835477

and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good added kitty: 8.441318582370407

yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr: 8.934309165612376

bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness: 10.231305170746491

elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs: 12.488611861199704

that is a question which mr: 11.785897942822725

indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them: 6.815866144919804

this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr: 11.490042797736713

collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh: 9.293050412120078

newby chief executive and director gbnewby <MENTION> section <NUM>: 9.929323068633071

you provide in accordance with paragraph <NUM>: 22.46430386986808

darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough: 12.917960231943555

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr: 9.446428529408903

their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this: 6.276117324281934

darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm: 14.83551846815684

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections: 8.395054503827225

wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going: 12.989611953110218

but our visitor was very obstinate: 6.668492540526745

all field sports were over: 4.731010981958166

rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit: 9.432761236337969

elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants: 6.977322125082021

and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason: 9.037533407739478

how does georgiana get on darcy: 7.94422461683853

had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps: 6.921853751353591

you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within <NUM> days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg tm license: 10.956445231481798

collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking: 8.960465314142326

elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was: 8.80964510305195

stone: 4.243243607058394

it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours: 9.031228745787073

when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were: 22.978073692914865

with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success: 9.65816711709499

your tempers are by no means unlike: 6.858330613961216

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling: 8.629970781832348

its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs: 9.395217168277448

so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find: 13.442846505402596

i am very glad you liked her: 7.842263637502978

on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared: 8.883900782054186

chapter xi: 41.8234927634775

but do not be cast down: 12.289469454305927

this is my advice: 6.216446140585722

nothing could console and nothing appease her: 4.436798462835477

they repulsed every attempt of mrs: 6.440716370928451

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first: 5.424713086051876

you had much better dance: 9.91496958566952

we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon: 6.492922801016872

her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh: 8.764534436889246

but at least it shews that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey: 6.580549658488319

bennet was stirring the fire: 10.41919292413536

very nonsensical to come at all: 5.123355165320486

he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere: 7.241319589444162

your father of course may spare you if your mother can: 7.50423367300463

do not wish me such an evil: 19.59050044992775

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr: 4.054012752117162

when is your turn to come: 15.449162049691937

and what arts did he use to separate them: 6.459661227761189

she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present: 7.959019590661432

i have certainly meant well through the whole affair: 8.027967215823091

but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much: 13.766559884660431

you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general: 12.53985962829748

darcy before they had known any thing of the matter: 6.849288915608731

the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again: 11.29378386081785

i am dear sir c: 5.683236979186422

that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him: 9.81915958816153

she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh: 12.400875925882756

it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way: 9.269148603253958

they then went away: 26.66488601324537

only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage: 7.79025852463059

this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming: 11.738311017664792

bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him: 8.316836056905045

illustration a vicarage house: 5.48900802570528

the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced: 8.844879385233263

his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking: 9.196705614473721

but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design: 7.610983927352963

i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes: 11.152827467904938

no my dear i think not: 10.412181400325585

he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein: 11.646671414112998

by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st: 12.408647723033198

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement: 10.266364717543082

_we_ were always good friends and now we are better: 7.824461719802057

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs: 15.057076937756763

_ _engraved for no: 8.832275715885471

i hardly know how mr: 10.59731122406663

i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning: 16.975163608731496

it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn: 7.981403320712656

gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers: 7.393567069220507

i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr: 8.300729836506369

yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation: 7.791862738910676

after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men: 7.903471967471087

wickham who left the place immediately and mrs: 8.510637488884957

indeed jane you ought to believe me: 9.824937839635453

you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound: 7.252526878229728

you are quite right: 7.621863673155442

bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr: 11.315205786401368

the gentlemen did approach and when mr: 10.545978549406664

if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable: 10.758965449769821

hurst s gown here she was interrupted again: 8.464801059776416

to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men: 11.022679496511088

at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life: 8.024141173654238

while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her: 10.467959060944281

could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife: 4.373320268420798

to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart: 9.770486861792739

by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr: 4.595059227435462

are you not diverted: 2.844384935531778

be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy: 19.94926430502931

come as soon as you can on the receipt of this: 6.7056639648289105

darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right: 9.372334128227648

i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him: 7.366691388709998

except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 15.235313684986325

i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him: 17.287401029968414

gracechurch street sept: 16.64510142004183

hurst and miss bingley: 3.6928195590316575

gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country: 12.342349092921172

it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr: 10.137241013433243

you know my sentiments: 9.809388309075585

she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded: 7.827054336998598

can you come to morrow: 6.53731533275514

most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote: 10.323436689994653

and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did: 7.91876953921264

a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh: 9.527792796865159

philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she _did_ speak she must be vulgar: 10.39869006806161

she had very little notice from any but him: 11.28909072609698

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn: 6.980536968436391

collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much: 5.894570669189146

we were married you know at st: 8.151037453566177

bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy: 16.14767508083633

bingley her sister s being in town: 18.200154547427132

but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own: 9.314969064837795

let me be rightly understood: 4.510854730563979

i am sure there is not on _his_: 13.077646770375589

i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word: 17.46104005197222

wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be: 10.011457492988859

most willingly: 4.884528382130216

and taking her hand he would have given it to mr: 27.05573244494932

darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing: 7.820652305380645

but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt: 9.150149464996463

in future i hope we shall be always of one mind: 8.625521330436689

he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion: 12.611422981374055

a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved: 8.493867845379844

yes and i had heard it before: 11.978355134886698

and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew s sister: 10.581281183942659

i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required: 8.516444982466213

how well it sounds: 8.313615074488796

from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents: 9.0606409460484

bennet with civil self command to miss lucas: 11.270465396294295

my father bears it better: 6.602537415283124

well well i only hope it will last: 10.641806658329614

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr: 6.060633374845632

he brought it with him for us to see: 6.20394288121809

while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them: 11.741778848685835

not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive: 9.308171280141261

i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony: 6.74874192996832

that he should have been in love with her for so many months: 24.79670319806821

how can you contrive to write so even: 5.248572637668524

have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is: 8.75893537256977

bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself: 12.25459305321078

i hope he will overlook it: 10.02432296297535

it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world: 8.2278486162196

who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust: 7.787173665660282

when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character: 12.497641600230605

it is from my cousin mr: 8.820434663086269

as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of: 7.313864099408701

i described and enforced them earnestly: 6.144002443160097

and how impossible in others: 7.187303502439591

_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect and you set yourself against it: 5.522718359795402

she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr: 9.387989096792069

bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation: 11.505695694632633

the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen: 6.699160315329423

how you must have hated me after _that_ evening: 8.375148376213922

it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration: 8.504750381067245

every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time: 7.417040316164116

these recollections will not do at all: 3.5780256016260306

my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her: 10.98736391974976

elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so: 7.325671663721635

wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr: 9.838626176590143

they had several children: 6.467856438587348

lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention: 5.80053626503353

after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family: 8.775706765896754

on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr: 10.65422583814341

but what is that to me: 7.058968632605277

he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one: 6.574607150037873

long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza: 7.90350287029245

i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection: 7.022318548470857

i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind: 7.7157706149256144

at present i will say nothing about it: 9.563600452636988

had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister: 14.953536011389913

she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house: 8.85524917481898

when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music: 16.266455712709632

i am very very sorry: 5.293337547796074

every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away: 7.065789361996385

darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart: 13.587809196343448

they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters: 6.755339799449799

she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard: 9.17282965985078

i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way: 13.307971068408902

i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley: 7.9760680082405075

when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other: 11.703364320334988

hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr: 6.136278343466526

jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs: 9.963259574885225

they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds: 9.101146464354217

and if you will stay another _month_ complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large: 12.570321736959983

elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth: 8.49660173305256

you are quite a visit in my debt mr: 7.29999573709197

the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit: 10.110524934658393

long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips: 9.883282205250431

these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth: 4.234176091205755

you know not what you are about: 11.305318381609018

bennet one day what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane s: 8.40644479419073

she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed: 7.614915939408568

but what is to be done about pemberley: 3.5637704078475276

after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful: 11.111258617076663

some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr: 10.504333882768563

but gracious me: 6.51542092159828

of whom does jane ever think ill: 6.129262833174902

gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose: 9.09232438056573

how despicably have i acted: 12.304341530436195

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it: 8.440153637662783

darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow: 9.745344293190932

elizabeth had settled it that mr: 11.91937748920614

but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out: 6.613950326593287

bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses: 12.619204279554465

<NUM> a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <NUM> days of receipt of the work: 13.770741780847182

do not you know that mr: 7.024140063144025

yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement: 21.07512884717074

what do i not owe you: 9.024114739895493

it was to be such a secret: 11.710051624623869

what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut: 17.390799689256173

collins in time: 23.418779763329063

in that case he would return no more: 11.696648547477343

i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude: 7.796820992041246

collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others: 12.165740951727544

he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear: 9.025639029909023

however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were: 10.638577016319333

the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him: 10.14985521596108

annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post: 11.264032219256965

bingley will not be detained in london by them: 6.169530726467791

at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs: 11.008492777412958

it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again: 10.747431434157303

the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr: 9.687516923375775

when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention: 15.455103742934824

bingley whose blind partiality provoked her: 7.403878286218971

it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire: 8.736186573316257

yes she will do for him very well: 16.81303224759373

she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place: 9.368267412578833

bingley and netherfield: 5.22956752647679

my dear charles what do you mean: 24.212607582769788

wickham began the subject himself: 12.254012674175991

they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought: 9.567707853646567

she plays and sings all day long: 6.671048469700148

no nothing at all: 8.500604416115106

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business: 11.43765958624865

it will save me a world of trouble and economy: 10.78531329662265

he danced only four dances: 36.868983733770975

jones says we must not think of moving her: 5.465407944226835

collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs: 9.560529869598131

then turning to mr: 6.746127958633967

i will speak to her about it myself directly: 9.06481684518464

he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while: 10.235526899708395

perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice: 5.7999540314229945

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance: 9.233075577735923

did charlotte dine with you: 10.760296548747109

darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise: 9.856231771057537

for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well: 10.049718736366868

how can you be smiling so lizzy: 5.129842298652901

but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage: 12.147572503297706

i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere: 5.978980695255687

well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth: 15.082173072498342

when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room: 9.527595413962334

but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair: 9.8499262897656

his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do: 10.952151758099516

she will be married: 16.514822502331963

there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood: 8.539778692753618

that lady i suppose is your mother: 10.519092441837092

wickham has deserved much less attention from mr: 9.318493848177654

but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly: 9.266255649049354

but who was your mother: 9.236553606521735

the sight of miss lucas was odious to her: 4.781886856656005

you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert: 7.122223616464309

i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character: 6.638658501406616

there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds: 8.36437948463834

the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation: 11.017249814249524

but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched: 13.138180954203632

but of course she did not mention my name to you: 7.9260750490422325

some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know: 8.481915528648148

till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr: 6.67608300282436

the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving: 8.61106261373598

pride prejudice: 16.001231248538815

indeed i do not dare: 16.637929909320356

her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical: 6.2918626255636445

how is half such a sum to be repaid: 9.986933901762889

but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable: 8.581483885731402

though lydia s short letter to mrs: 7.334068904960147

shocking: 4.243243607058394

bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me: 5.478270831597814

she felt anew the justice of mr: 9.189422394215702

what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt: 11.406587176731826

i should like it beyond any thing: 9.692419857506028

collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself: 8.473757722616199

he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday: 8.72162319390565

wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs: 8.575033951097975

gardiner could not but be deeply affected: 11.173603291709487

where shall you change horses: 4.259629614139935

i am always glad to get a young person well placed out: 7.407263680713419

i send no compliments to your mother: 11.152827467904938

how i laughed: 25.51801842188013

i hope not so: 11.336037996006873

at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family: 14.962932964609987

what think you of books: 43.304559823993294

what does he say: 22.158425533561108

darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr: 7.873751549947326

and poor mr: 7.292187875481146

philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade: 8.96694091447783

there is a lady it seems a mrs: 5.36951591596102

<NUM> and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder: 7.900846250342299

bingley followed his advice: 7.568333366965928

it would be dreadful: 16.721316028710028

though i thought it would be very good fun if i was: 28.00570418056343

long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise: 9.031470880476473

in another minute mr: 8.216855580044799

it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain: 9.523865340444551

we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth: 8.34057483523366

it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side: 7.575921443066609

the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr: 8.171275244658704

whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr: 7.901615248872114

but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment: 7.8373453327811555

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character: 5.61158816555845

my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to: 10.024306251320555

darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her: 8.01726817143684

his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr: 8.60485165498329

i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object: 9.485262860351625

it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial: 25.963245567988643

bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine: 11.975858864877063

is _her_ husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother: 5.859245669373442

darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her: 8.18224838424602

one seems so forlorn without them: 5.169032980548087

the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification: 8.619403033717033

added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune: 6.131288237709374

when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish: 11.145245371839977

but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it: 14.654785521784662

all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation: 7.079039664438552

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs: 10.010674659069261

can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this: 5.249227562734254

darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning: 7.283261635841717

end of the second volume: 5.439905203181546

hang kitty: 4.797141785693573

and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him: 8.395408636189368

your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you: 9.893257351684703

he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey: 11.160496093403717

painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled: 6.395492587743277

he still loves me and we are engaged: 9.282476542884877

collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater: 9.7543462510689

i must ask whether you were surprised: 5.650014811056372

i am not now to learn replied mr: 8.628167928878716

well my dear said mr: 31.649963003359257

the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of: 8.274329715946308

philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces: 9.07689751400441

perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybody s_ reserve can be answerable for the event: 7.002007532100069

four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival: 7.197630300212938

that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before: 18.868104837234558

they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain: 12.613702938493141

if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy: 9.584958703517739

when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again: 15.631749960778233

she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it: 17.500854979111026

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it: 12.347330075590106

i cannot think so very ill of wickham: 15.107753781710267

well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done: 15.05862939577266

collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs: 8.086772828495171

my dear sir replied mr: 26.670594967598625

they were excessively sorry to go: 14.666898829331183

bingley i am sure: 8.058268240817863

the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable: 11.053955311316122

it was mr: 5.569348069044251

the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me: 11.793794475955142

her heart did whisper that he had done it for her: 6.779339089997996

i never thought mr: 6.960746520905405

i am so happy: 19.989796730575357

elizabeth s courage did not fail her: 8.676458292951903

but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present: 9.786594276211941

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in: 10.240609291266951

my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street: 11.146293257077968

but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished: 10.517742309994059

but does lydia know nothing of this: 6.988411108041807

such were the gentle murmurs of mrs: 8.634764622676053

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection: 7.435263441520266

i do think mrs: 8.48296627733257

to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone: 9.277408198240213

scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings: 21.503838218359835

on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all: 10.447883213789552

their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself: 10.778709557524973

you are over scrupulous surely: 5.398689997267069

iii: 4.243243607058394

while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr: 6.956145610719869

bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr: 7.830222624606831

her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it: 9.27405406166647

yes to the last: 7.804380175874019

what could he mean: 6.050462359277335

it is _not_ mr: 5.86906701351304

i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy: 8.205770108613596

he readily agreed to it: 14.652173110987288

bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income: 8.180497875185656

collins first came to hunsford: 16.538614971212326

i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better: 8.88076125593714

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them: 9.661055160865393

young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life: 7.722603546322472

i knew that mr: 5.68249951077745

when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs: 10.608012358728105

i think you said she was a widow sir: 13.052365585064274

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all <NUM> states of the united states: 7.023446093623946

they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs: 8.363907665729428

if _i_ can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too: 10.814863411491354

darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs: 5.453418254153879

here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country: 11.779343713017806

my poor father: 14.283257378587859

the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles: 6.8276234621031575

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry: 12.498165348038505

professor michael s: 5.163608515151185

he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy: 16.440316616320654

this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr: 6.345327388125068

gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world: 7.00908683498159

jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me: 15.490048234785554

darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day: 8.33989491603955

my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned: 15.168771068904336

that he has neither integrity nor honour: 6.203482792714054

you are severe on us: 8.200417037327375

i had not thought mr: 10.614997604820308

there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton: 14.310510958433662

philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards: 9.416538113982996

i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings: 9.420107679411556

she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress: 7.751593162871544

i only hope they may have half my good luck: 10.416420442487544

darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer: 7.193575757351231

but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me: 12.97346319766312

whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy: 6.149797812288848

her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you: 8.495675517390719

collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure: 11.735256566332756

darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party: 6.8521130066348706

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed: 7.611964167484695

i congratulate her: 5.715054997780767

her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates: 8.44730025617783

i never was: 3.880191407628979

if indeed it should be so: 22.182102825058898

elizabeth smiled: 14.858507528405935

additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work: 7.8834130810465455

she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name: 9.223217895254459

her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms: 9.081403463439878

she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side: 10.992343241811776

so tall: 5.255610217846075

they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects: 10.21368119235209

lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr: 11.599996667651288

i am trying to make it out: 15.144784021684908

we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb: 6.83887459226293

we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome: 8.538258133311752

collins s scruples of leaving mr: 5.746694537980914

do not you want to know who has taken it: 11.911154347241121

but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together: 13.029546033537613

elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her: 12.945075979209046

with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand: 7.832083717120167

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs: 7.676072724858364

there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well: 8.451908774703803

to know that her daughter would be married was enough: 23.708598537837002

he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr: 7.147236178165446

to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female: 7.825888928646931

now is your time: 4.568431753289777

mamma would like to go too of all things: 22.92761983945026

philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs: 6.365446925854796

elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr: 10.780985262930749

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand: 9.727677226144625

laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion: 8.474571594201375

gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own: 8.477012056426782

<NUM> or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs <NUM>: 7.536866011675436

but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr: 7.350784058222878

yes but he seemed to like his second better: 7.443536344027917

but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations: 8.62051656840418

they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs: 10.207910215347116

only think: 7.318553495576358

cried he: 3.0103261890260593

gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject: 7.354117751160256

in talking over their route the evening before mrs: 12.25240050336515

nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight: 4.811716112987106

she had ventured only one glance at darcy: 6.6019869070681

a short pause followed this speech and mrs: 6.682784181470684

sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with: 7.849435125961889

this will never do: 13.97935186121652

gardiner abused her stupidity: 8.144802513878664

were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion: 12.379097536350535

i do not mind his not talking to mrs: 6.785687447841656

illustration morning dress: 5.238722263340543

you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged: 6.708463361981139

had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family: 9.700921681517674

but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away: 9.339946139617192

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs: 12.098993199310325

the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person: 10.096838762422006

i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly: 8.729760987742557

i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner: 24.16798339678866

the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances: 8.213295719453642

she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind: 9.808303109739603

yes i call it a _very_ easy distance: 18.231350515562497

the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak: 7.810313096250733

multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets example m rs: 6.189428463051814

no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard: 8.560745704256101

my good opinion once lost is lost for ever: 9.96969912805873

she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters: 7.9104459424742775

bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for _her_ and live to see her take my place in it: 10.126469828093475

this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least: 13.315160345681857

collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings: 10.327762521101448

if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me: 9.213881786778638

widely different was the effect of a second perusal: 12.95537236304823

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country: 5.822006691145274

thank you but i always mend my own: 16.36684251284205

my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine: 12.013295930647649

perfectly so i thank you: 8.620231093224099

you do not look well: 13.016352634422283

elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying: 10.818010035994678

elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough: 7.858101869297703

what could be the meaning of it: 5.83072507610355

all this was acknowledged to mrs: 5.667073670769519

cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came: 10.538717618915125

upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward: 13.778080433212242

when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister: 8.958334996833392

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could: 13.309839919954369

and then when we came away it was such fun: 11.903640249218475

bingley is most unaffectedly modest: 11.352612449807385

but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit: 6.770926028533978

i will try again: 6.960746520905405

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr: 12.017130244921763

the children have been wanting me this half hour: 15.103214937032732

removed: 4.243243607058394

his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure: 8.040567198885528

wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed: 9.322462557134743

elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile: 13.515503513734162

in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society: 8.085924787402794

but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could: 8.408514770247445

i will put on my things in a moment: 5.172664930053015

his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment: 9.23880800409528

he does not want abilities: 5.252323846608894

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr: 6.8063798262409945

as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables: 7.297063444470686

a great deal more passed at the other table: 11.413835456825645

will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him: 13.071619183047526

do not think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side: 8.280292730360667

she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months: 11.531375027340182

give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey: 6.0381145718496665

hill and the two housemaids: 6.47022505055486

she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet: 11.656240185578161

her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice: 10.684055345003118

perhaps i am not doing her justice: 10.52588992260487

are the others coming out: 6.4702250505548635

the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did: 12.00940376056289

from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him: 8.080533965384147

his surprise was great: 7.628898840801042

lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable: 7.264638919023474

there can be no doubt of that: 47.99628138857921

both sisters were uncomfortable enough: 12.959445226613974

i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother: 8.840456065877751

accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer: 14.250782598282964

though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour: 6.060226128470142

and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty: 10.152480289101177

brother in law of wickham: 7.904144679612913

they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone: 10.36604136038075

i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night: 5.494281785392068

it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present: 6.9143301092500495

and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away: 17.096349385766985

what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer: 8.922754929628622

she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable: 7.742006586761313

but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me: 7.990248654380529

bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr: 8.597077405205082

sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before: 7.77603338290205

let me never see either one or the other again: 6.8849722677122696

this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he: 12.543744642790767

but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it: 8.10909830860074

bingley to _her_: 6.9211054661870515

they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible: 7.109678319159597

lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over: 8.158955864561042

elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect: 6.9890448995929075

you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends: 11.552610906134673

she now lost every expectation of pleasure: 9.234167443858594

it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner: 11.788125205012705

bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion: 11.501655776516413

bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was: 7.871716508606737

let me hear what it is: 5.4647092391016665

he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it: 9.186536051953233

what would she have said: 18.76888746535904

young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer: 20.138062266557426

forster and me are _such_ friends: 5.0227956573549495

she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty: 8.90045300475607

lydia my love ring the bell: 10.222548079110494

bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his: 11.63719337052596

gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both: 8.195471409200577

how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow: 14.240751196209057

darcy s eyes were fixed on her: 16.744415530996598

bennet s eyes sparkled: 19.557681398792

you appear to me mr: 9.914969585669526

the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage: 7.793788647123533

darcy she could not but allow that mr: 11.207349774755897

the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country: 12.702138742394302

a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite: 7.4932537606379555

do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley: 8.204610139313758

i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing: 15.307989825832609

i dare say the lace upon mrs: 9.176145492269312

he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence: 6.928244416953106

collins s admiration: 9.220060189624625

it is of no consequence: 9.129363737839041

the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid: 8.646926318953666

i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle: 10.325773348457028

i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception: 12.218633260209058

i had not an idea of it: 7.046011078456342

he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again: 9.551936288140904

jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day: 8.91236859172076

what news: 9.172205251573164

collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could: 11.366711261110327

tis an etiquette i despise said he: 7.615520807940125

what can have induced him to behave so cruelly: 7.262733394092908

you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr: 7.113905681855576

the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful: 7.4927718721246155

they agreed that mrs: 10.053766250507753

he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names: 6.903216999518757

elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr: 10.010003835856105

catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london: 9.156898519661377

it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express: 12.658291202668712

there is something very pompous in his style: 6.563791835172987

they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs: 9.643093551327246

good god: 3.708792627759515

she is my youngest girl but one: 6.975103468690598

the rector of a parish has much to do: 10.690391040601117

he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably: 6.403044945996549

i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance: 8.478360925082823

they insist also on my seeing mr: 6.9367830702359985

she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation: 7.442212240554269

collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer: 11.084342678990826

i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world: 6.056986179045956

if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far: 10.696238390298868

gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire: 10.162451916402278

it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like: 7.763992476777239

the next day opened a new scene at longbourn: 5.300835754780768

she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him: 12.045997217730132

he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone: 11.413199540893068

bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months: 6.599392360612407

when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion: 7.926226689866715

cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted: 4.748959209830612

darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr: 7.752737698396426

but we considered it we talked of it as impossible: 16.43714211755065

she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr: 8.425397119260749

impossible mr: 9.969899159196563

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation: 7.251787581640373

<NUM> or <NUM>: 26.704057016480345

at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave: 6.44761441622933

not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you: 9.631054273342167

with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted: 5.217735257511913

here you are in your own family: 4.866253062381647

but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet: 9.837505155785273

that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr: 10.083331198625

lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed: 12.051978121634226

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there: 9.326265455051006

you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer: 8.43419295715432

you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice: 10.0465890405874

i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer: 8.868375183817069

bennet cried his wife what are you talking of: 9.198957890767549

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it: 10.246821849092001

in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger: 9.122335325636035

collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason: 11.58118479895454

your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr: 7.184728363532949

it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure: 10.607047582767105

ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it: 7.359679553791944

darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least: 6.440643911045984

you have said quite enough madam: 7.426457820903788

darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling: 6.1459690463920875

my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it: 7.788920763147431

she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her: 10.82130999912699

i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter: 8.84280161984532

what has she frightened away some of your lovers: 13.065578288754548

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility: 9.144044138097735

while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes: 11.278814881710199

and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh: 7.491914839637801

the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose: 6.198831939600409

both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds: 8.120523620588134

to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible: 7.058855434507665

it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know: 8.932971121928661

it is a nice long walk and mr: 5.706791291476906

end of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice this file should be named <NUM> <NUM>: 4.133461987370076

the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question: 11.975479110764864

bennet as he folded up the letter: 5.6163140601068235

but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable: 15.57324860933604

bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday: 11.370312161232276

it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours: 7.819215000774728

as soon as jane had read mr: 7.336947291369284

elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month: 10.996654145076883

though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not: 11.418993448667536

indeed i had: 24.17430451600471

believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections: 6.923862111141396

three daughters married: 5.163608515151185

but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company: 8.692779035144952

i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance: 8.025418233016568

collins so before you came: 10.88808713109488

there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way: 13.145468217402817

bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon: 12.819613121575584

but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world: 11.053029685476492

there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much: 9.212044916160574

elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr: 9.109468598040266

they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment: 7.968531209389948

last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary: 10.847100859235903

dear lizzy: 3.0103261890260593

this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself: 10.387123792214354

darcy said very little and mr: 7.6438001721252915

others of the party were now applied to: 4.639234910403504

but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read: 8.572281397321392

what could be more natural than his asking you again: 7.904198860327297

but i know the foundation is unjust: 18.525952649935284

they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr: 8.575537649556152

chapter xxii: 9.682865003888603

i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it: 9.073652149013238

she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr: 6.781616850878582

and with a low bow he left her to attack mr: 7.66999585112884

now what have you to say: 3.6895540108107125

are you going much farther: 3.2303707043612224

but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model: 13.134352224867301

he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire: 8.183263617654852

he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent: 6.432771128026138

whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to _you_: 8.782170502405771

or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others: 7.871687254352851

do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart: 9.931712178426666

it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best: 11.116536238004588

elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr: 9.988022855122583

no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself: 12.463869095665617

they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight: 7.122472951603386

i believe madam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him: 5.293946253209479

wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself: 7.768740929359715

as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery: 8.507593276466993

darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year: 7.624214672553241

bennet you will wait on him of course: 14.993019339983288

if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least: 9.952494134863299

yes certainly: 9.63832380636961

it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match: 10.296256505180722

she added by far too much: 6.699368380657733

how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book: 6.280899550497003

he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday: 6.928730135007033

the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation: 7.784978268579791

you must send john with the young ladies mrs: 13.12506327678227

bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth: 9.480311511950507

hurst began again: 10.337063618096192

nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled: 11.625742759198552

darcy just deigned to return: 6.728973568028507

wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball: 8.684257869000781

lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure: 16.789814266330044

it was very little less: 5.492529139179984

you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty: 6.933472350306467

bingley and under your orders: 8.609468427509977

i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life: 6.2772152403523345

but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr: 13.353510055148556

we have heard nothing from town: 9.205658361536715

the visit was returned in due form: 6.328883746222394

how i long to see her: 17.202044198742545

bingley will like it lizzy: 6.853055290849846

i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen: 5.486121041267654

the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments: 9.828799986310592

collins and lizzy: 4.9324632768120305

but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr: 8.041054642941454

but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood: 8.84873791141565

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr: 8.162809898474595

lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself: 11.028149823777072

if i could but see _you_ as happy: 7.865961078581153

when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr: 12.080346308539214

as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it: 7.4263184280929515

she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side: 8.799271045392809

w: 29.8483178791824

but i think mr: 30.28674934799362

the day passed much as the day before had done: 7.396191469822275

where is your sister: 16.964621662858498

we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her: 7.99686170502697

oh brother how kind you are: 11.391626479447797

her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire: 10.260220597240703

bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from: 10.061930657004691

he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask: 5.58997649656

bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent: 8.767873082831734

till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose _him_: 5.303668242123685

wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet: 12.99042526074144

elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend: 7.2584313289439235

what a contrast between him and his friend: 7.720685139432277

why was he to be the judge: 8.295234088381923

his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go: 8.828733756771294

elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ the worth of each was eclipsed by mr: 8.034849284730585

bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together: 12.419859577471637

a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr: 10.119560012056466

at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing: 10.545770919597452

to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good: 10.646501905714281

his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature: 8.604851654983293

_she_ blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour: 11.036529234412729

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away: 9.182845713593057

said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it: 12.601768158186866

she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged mr: 11.94705017246402

elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it: 7.940922751143126

certainly: 2.2254569186482254

and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose: 8.965314950778845

the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr: 12.93078843170889

i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after: 7.970266394628004

is not there a little mistake: 8.919619860178996

gregory b: 4.797141785693573

he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley: 12.132020955329567

what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here: 14.739284088375353

you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you: 9.537433957799006

she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr: 11.25288109117486

jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening: 17.903294013737042

lady catherine s great attentions to mrs: 8.187478590854331

but perhaps mr: 4.423593523927366

bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf: 6.675511812489826

darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs: 10.308322392027652

elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion: 7.3501334565656

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful: 11.678465636491703

as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen: 7.493225400538999

lady catherine seemed resigned: 17.17167265072682

hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker: 7.406374402170078

this is an evening of wonders indeed: 8.922992752789941

illustration matlock pride and prejudice a novel: 5.800127761381725

so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible: 14.793243233545663

he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger: 7.544220711578385

darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner: 12.54616535392526

elizabeth looked surprised: 21.03038206816397

if _you_ have not been mistaken here _i_ must have been in an error: 10.07815023955585

it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling: 5.647382260897178

but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design: 6.874321337133336

my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not: 10.697511310896585

unless a copyright notice is included: 5.818747074035808

he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life: 6.76711214026665

eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds: 11.22719191468266

but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art: 6.3836162326256

he was received by mrs: 5.219840057244809

your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr: 10.826862445718488

mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected: 7.078647692110168

the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away: 10.851586374454929

his misfortunes: 9.315081763738721

darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on _fine eyes_: 11.988081348616541

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin: 7.4525400716012795

how merry we shall be together when we meet: 9.545310567719214

their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room: 12.20603845543215

jane looked at her doubtingly: 11.11873965427712

i am not equal to it: 8.447595918706583

you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared: 8.855964330496645

i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable: 7.397188121388013

you do not blame me however for refusing him: 17.62136905754791

the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance: 10.265590764493668

_mr: 4.243243607058394

unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds: 5.271993893221422

you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did: 8.631560795805552

he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty: 6.192689956771101

the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks: 10.697373804058753

elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others: 11.0635600521881

but really madam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early: 12.098169645614622

his temptation is not adequate to the risk: 7.801470344579209

collins s joints of meat were too large for her family: 5.7062158062820485

i expected to find a more reasonable young woman: 10.228941190833135

i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement: 9.104268312013735

i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again: 7.000568185217528

bingley _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work _my_ daughters are brought up differently: 7.126693643627799

and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it: 7.668295989687191

darcy bowed: 6.580868266316908

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend: 5.373786231177672

she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine: 8.17879537351001

she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice: 11.442893413506274

in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger: 13.485689815075101

my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed: 7.3795387625905144

gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s: 9.016353803110329

bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate: 9.489690371951543

her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming: 7.691284871126645

who would have thought it: 4.393513644106334

every thing nourishes what is strong already: 4.436798462835477

bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last: 8.83871409755876

jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness: 11.594110679297023

if it was not for the entail i should not mind it: 8.591871179494817

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family: 9.311198636455618

though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr: 8.773035248077823

the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this: 5.900114585614649

such a countenance such manners: 10.27005462023952

about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr: 8.28372513986224

bennet protested against any description of finery: 6.908649533709705

miss bingley was engrossed by mr: 6.093832495484754

he was angry: 6.863613340887195

bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together: 9.358374971701414

_invented by m rs bell <NUM> charlotte street bedford square: 6.131288237709374

darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr: 8.273296761327787

for my part mr: 3.7153456099432223

the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr: 8.88459354230412

after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr: 7.348200608343728

the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr: 6.86293026087052

there mrs: 9.63832380636961

reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time: 12.385216531495088

philips and _she_ ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton: 10.072409880033883

bennet i am quite delighted with him: 7.522452554181502

chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_ let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way: 7.5338909292881135

about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention: 9.532823787328843

charlotte herself was tolerably composed: 4.259629614139935

bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign: 7.0071160861923305

darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting: 9.850135409629587

you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves: 10.08270376077786

it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland: 7.786117255511324

collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases: 10.86982455364362

but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents: 10.899565754403158

his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind: 14.274048887667416

collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home: 7.036086115413694

collins too: 7.350719077955638

soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were: 14.56306471503099

to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either: 9.063265832940077

never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings: 8.360191272301403

bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding: 7.62537426532557

she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you: 7.059685873897894

i desire you will stay where you are: 25.584678897639936

and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace: 9.650973749486857

the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above: 6.799998457780652

very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business: 8.23229600309916

would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again: 10.998168996857386

be assured my dear sir that mrs: 17.817799971770306

he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child: 11.476159677020968

when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr: 10.026645101063203

there was no arguing upon such a project: 6.758884167879361

darcy and mr: 3.674739476187512

you cannot be too much on your guard: 18.89391426460813

i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man: 6.722000838365552

to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther: 7.574579602673174

if i have i shall be the last person to confess it: 10.165841489848866

after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt: 13.939595080602311

darcy could have such boundless influence: 6.260423828024219

gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her: 9.612293522218993

reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister: 10.274369403344743

it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations: 6.115538504620429

it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before: 8.065220863504962

i cannot think of it without abhorrence: 6.211334290630984

it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor: 7.637119243604694

he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions: 7.4802385602682095

indeed you are mistaken: 28.89338908269861

my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me: 10.400571555043117

they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs: 8.607162387578576

you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him: 9.198781216143908

darcy contradict it: 6.649573983120321

darcy they had only seen at church: 6.773493388946586

she had gained her point and had time to consider of it: 8.347096170578096

she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition: 8.198931077608696

i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse: 8.341845987410021

bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband: 6.88952360361965

i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy: 14.318585789767653

in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin: 8.574879126646904

but while he was mortal there must be a triumph: 9.377710314766743

we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care: 9.19164073049219

darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation: 8.061694593687161

supposing him to be attached to me would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin: 6.818894852460925

you must come and make lizzy marry mr: 6.238145218336253

bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them: 11.606569220883971

i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think: 8.33655552512305

the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious: 9.123986074350938

you ought all to have learned: 10.22858426837661

and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married: 10.31723360895072

tis as good as a lord: 7.705618789936222

i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help: 8.58022538231061

and mary king is safe: 10.917256987099545

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject: 7.726189311129138

she is quite a little creature: 10.063384147442028

the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr: 6.35313444021913

said charlotte as soon as he was gone: 3.014051113154545

cried his wife impatiently: 3.9751587646603954

bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required: 8.127096924824377

he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them: 8.715863170162612

she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung: 7.11741661694909

it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane: 8.131899808094266

that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does _not_ write with ease: 15.986945460451153

bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof: 6.862830087167115

bingley arrived: 7.908283304121674

in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton: 8.25512544737361

i cannot do justice to his kindness: 9.839590849542118

wickham so very bad: 8.273955581485763

and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs: 7.232138256008375

the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs: 5.934010316316808

has she been presented: 10.416905029765669

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet: 10.236682680664254

the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting: 7.861191821577306

he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him: 9.829550489950607

gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power: 17.60270077038876

his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure: 8.911398421734733

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting: 7.994342644049847

i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason: 8.911264528108386

it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction: 10.690134583071773

collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility: 7.557735929207659

bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion _his_ mind was not very differently engaged: 12.724788548893496

and what do you think she said besides: 12.213909484926315

pray what is your age: 4.398423884002787

dear yes but you must own she is very plain: 7.7960088231112765

but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time: 9.91046004097927

a little sea bathing would set me up for ever: 8.108165604858955

robert william chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever: 59.211476778714164

nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation: 8.960754944342025

the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study: 8.943376980471784

bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner: 14.614779198438875

the promised letter of thanks from mr: 6.038856276306513

you are not going to introduce yourself to mr: 8.2228968298213

darcy a most intimate confidential friend: 6.753979838362806

my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology: 7.341133868095125

that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head: 7.581927516365816

have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference: 10.001754223799045

bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs: 7.481958940914618

on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book: 9.417121474612223

you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them: 15.519380283929607

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine: 6.475901143021117

till this moment i never knew myself: 4.746395738716702

he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all: 8.032834494826673

thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room: 6.398755139810836

it is a long time mr: 6.4184390710385

my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal: 13.144462918197837

elizabeth was now to see mr: 22.835830435094017

she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success: 9.735106847571759

bennet and prepared for backgammon: 5.234333091775486

i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies: 8.284540793431368

away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech: 6.3222676933454265

the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment: 11.608234170496724

she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother: 6.191143703915029

darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer: 8.133059913141588

it was kindly meant: 5.776210626876551

if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her: 12.548693624927276

a carat character is used to denote superscription: 8.052023525823586

it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her: 7.780950992821844

two days after mr: 21.816975702507758

the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits: 11.188993339657731

in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation: 7.979518766107182

consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr: 8.43856208624563

bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage: 11.501980424941483

not a soul knew of it but col: 14.616473274017363

you could not make _me_ happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so: 9.05109384030128

how hard it is in some cases to be believed: 9.687592324260743

nobody can tell what i suffer: 17.277136119668196

he was silent: 10.914145515566844

it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago: 7.045693803675097

next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then: 9.195729163330649

_you_ observed it mr: 5.052232480627023

it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent: 10.123759289259889

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn: 8.668146079067347

mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how: 5.851192164799355

hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am: 8.899736799038328

she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success: 11.414044867439053

your examination of mr: 6.596648727166348

but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him: 8.338272895845133

on finding mrs: 10.127107265536546

her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day: 8.143459056093446

her aunt now called her to look at a picture: 7.186230093158915

the possibility of meeting mr: 5.323308424131608

i should be sorry indeed if it were: 10.617877107857666

bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning: 13.127145176680886

kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy: 9.676342370949037

i am not romantic you know: 7.09029939623422

why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear: 9.191629865150164

when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr: 13.490804241933589

if his own vanity however did not mislead him _he_ was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer: 7.318179408940668

her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room: 14.876406047461508

bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son: 9.816564065692852

no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy: 7.435252488451032

elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley: 9.822518442318954

we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s: 7.023626975797275

bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house: 7.909930863561032

she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise: 7.252898063927883

they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others: 12.71565419941129

wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable: 13.145610563933149

a lively imagination soon settled it all: 8.253143060558116

the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention: 10.113212715327238

what none of you: 8.455799416344645

bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters: 11.76836343199933

miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy: 16.073581753362816

she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley: 8.76496555927233

she stared coloured doubted and was silent: 8.63184238648302

wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows: 9.618422870001396

bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner: 16.507724031969012

we want none of them do we: 4.59906332488902

at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting: 7.870815619226972

they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens: 7.662493593163688

and have you heard from him often: 19.061888857089226

it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of: 16.115249240307854

i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself: 10.555682735453846

the loo table however did not appear: 6.379866622940825

bingley might like you the best of the party: 7.125372442792001

i must speak to hill this moment: 7.310700492111004

very true and if i had my will we should: 3.8742858655321744

as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown: 11.8608950481209

it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour: 20.363992189592825

collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character: 9.307059953219659

but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else: 9.81518891291349

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs: 6.08747778150124

with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic: 5.280111854436839

its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned: 10.29266821292771

attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham: 6.06328077325631

there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire: 13.28511817166651

as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more: 9.290196046930106

to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own: 10.515075861841735

of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt: 12.051775927499031

this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth: 5.860755414349732

and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself: 8.431116192256344

she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her: 8.39643795832392

you refuse then to oblige me: 10.22858426837661

if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this: 11.516904553516348

bingley returned mr: 7.702523635731165

how shall we punish him for such a speech: 11.568782911470969

i beg you will not go: 12.50097551575886

yes she will remain there till christmas: 11.198334251448344

she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly: 8.571456386717458

i am sick of mr: 9.944235233382186

who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual: 8.589273966809422

the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago: 7.2564183879758515

philips first brought her the news: 6.062972055902725

little more than half a day s journey: 9.51331211632586

of mr: 3.2390232670109236

his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr: 8.948511435011541

she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes: 10.801911590269578

to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr: 9.748442865138115

they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long: 8.599180475881434

bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as mr: 6.300402716122745

her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it: 12.663213631325853

yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of: 7.9624322170585495

darcy afterwards discharged: 6.649573983120321

she looks sickly and cross: 6.5984081290641745

collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received: 10.515276704921334

collins well: 7.350719077955638

i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think: 7.901056440971733

what hours of transport we shall spend: 7.850501625153057

had she merely _dined_ with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal: 11.588353861549797

she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage: 11.974218644792856

this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married: 6.334836179978152

annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs: 7.487950183809297

almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life: 9.806264299565024

i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back: 11.11240945107643

in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it: 17.53135657418822

she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished: 9.403288019335688

generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself: 4.71564033967325

and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon: 13.235345736531603

i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns: 7.807084492374229

long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr: 10.912149684498793

my dear father she cried come back and write immediately: 12.35215265509822

thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women: 9.470325265612766

reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections: 8.582840765254472

speak to lizzy about it yourself: 5.766462055150584

bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy: 12.770958685093953

very much: 2.540162065094823

on the following monday mrs: 8.102834932242974

collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered: 7.13810733376028

the idea of mr: 4.131437754330141

remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do: 9.087086019117388

bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning: 9.554717324137041

that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations: 12.776996241236226

he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs: 7.396035890222656

you blamed me for coming: 7.1188175892237675

do you certainly leave kent on saturday: 8.790753928539818

bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough: 12.285117530251492

she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld: 9.150363294253028

i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him: 6.287724008171684

thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business: 16.223668962857484

she knew not what to think nor how to account for it: 10.51409360579091

it is unaccountable: 18.299901617788954

there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others: 9.17969485848393

collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands: 5.918716931649151

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness: 7.605823639415268

wickham too: 18.787103470098632

her own thoughts were employing her: 7.822930995975447

_they_ will never be distressed for money: 10.541520516919473

i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time: 7.527060452006716

oh sister: 9.007970174854602

you have sense and we all expect you to use it: 9.057756288684104

at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance: 14.088694695740653

no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame: 7.162875900149537

bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr: 7.471445676473712

so do not put yourself to inconvenience: 6.129262833174902

nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law: 7.9223726530594245

if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession: 9.447131934793916

do any thing rather than marry without affection: 19.911352408220097

collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge: 11.198721880073757

darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence: 9.375973269792983

he came to tell mr: 14.652173110987283

i cannot make him out: 4.713578218158606

i am most seriously displeased: 8.632633726863679

the church _ought_ to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now: 11.559266854108236

but it is so strange: 5.793420255220438

collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road: 10.46896787055766

but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked: 9.444145875497941

kitty owned that she had rather stay at home: 6.72751704319242

he had been some time with mr: 7.427682296508025

in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself: 8.962013676909208

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr: 6.23264397710937

you have a house in town i conclude: 22.220864832547658

the general prejudice against mr: 10.215281782276074

sir i do indeed: 7.633770582615052

an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family: 9.770150972190967

she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs: 10.585603376118456

and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son: 9.487773906103518

but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference: 9.579016319958797

what are we to do: 10.90448381503482

the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first: 8.899804944578673

collins and i will never see you again if you _do_: 13.70494582492764

i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished: 5.6114346947391835

a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected: 9.104492344998855

bingley were at piquet and mrs: 5.812389778814153

cried bingley: 2.9564699844464166

wretched wretched mistake: 5.163608515151185

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair: 7.51129269492454

i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter: 9.0307407414098

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible: 10.323792359752453

yes madam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor: 9.314798007735986

but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here: 8.942293706415105

elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation: 6.6882779866149535

there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed: 7.085250385659667

but your _family_ owe me nothing: 6.668492540526745

my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now: 11.74909780993706

this is a wretched beginning indeed: 5.921199420209682

my fingers wait your orders: 17.646684214020706

they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression: 5.746960399650436

elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them: 7.477476138264724

but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country: 9.280337986377898

the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed: 11.880463458697424

for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him: 9.893932327734285

darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs: 5.286552429208072

i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield: 9.351225246409218

jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes: 9.393694152339231

does your charge give you much trouble: 10.754861538266395

it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham: 9.593677289653241

but you are not entitled to know _mine_ nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit: 8.57048258369079

is that his design in settling here: 4.746395738716702

forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs: 5.810310216981631

is this thought elizabeth meant for me: 4.472539481019021

philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room: 8.560976454377577

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected: 8.360322810955052

to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected: 8.483865477195893

such an openness and gentleness in his manner: 4.99291125343814

it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr: 14.006139753664282

and it was not wholly without foundation: 10.350529767217571

after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f: 7.616890836342422

the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each: 8.503496133911415

however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham: 9.667534139537535

i am sorry to pain you but so it was: 11.950914083535098

bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar: 6.29906298561068

gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland: 11.171784917668985

bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down: 10.276043359929574

as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park: 12.957881904861862

my uncle: 6.078447775326857

yes all of them i think: 10.922372879341633

darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile: 13.293740321314244

your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings: 8.045288903857717

she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr: 9.033618400006569

you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg tm works: 15.89516776863356

except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate: 7.544201514838202

lady catherine i have nothing farther to say: 15.652199954488774

we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way: 8.441661526214016

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence: 5.584828773678932

twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too: 7.795056250198391

but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year: 9.352931112684697

but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy: 6.098163370493349

i write rather slowly: 9.61158931759396

as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither: 12.005169529937865

he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend: 6.659779089473439

when you told mrs: 22.328994298791905

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr: 9.01334238369459

darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr: 13.110452288722767

but she would not be secure: 8.122758476732491

gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation: 6.864203948210188

and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house: 13.502546876294401

darcy s looks and behaviour: 16.868974844062645

why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight: 6.539387196265359

bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied: 8.645969489852598

there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town: 11.509029343814387

would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe: 6.103214290780917

hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her: 12.513518576013961

yes if darcy does not put it off again: 13.303224146294353

tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day: 8.197812430957095

adieu: 11.254051893530947

at present i have not room to do them justice: 5.854490637555891

elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr: 11.58806881933357

you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him: 15.659965708006961

i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately: 6.864397050250899

how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner: 15.357570231092378

and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well: 8.834006630381094

i am ashamed of you: 5.742166918989982

i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary: 6.694851279680577

but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult: 8.95145763692223

poor reynolds she was always very fond of me: 11.717629722343958

i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character: 8.929999064631392

he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister: 7.591235295152742

i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this: 9.451489824658696

if i said mr: 6.857472669445037

no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did: 11.314312942974228

but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane: 14.697414328572888

bingley s friend without being heard by either of them: 8.7585736105006

if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach: 9.24475676335651

do you then pretend to be ignorant of it: 14.545893880826139

i am quite well: 3.598666382869597

dear me: 12.769970556263651

sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion: 8.454317531135844

and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy: 8.965314950778845

your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner: 25.862321384686894

information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit <NUM> c <NUM> educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service: 6.741308545238434

i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter: 6.899049123021456

_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte: 9.075683719764518

my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it: 8.316817995058887

you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice: 9.224023292977199

the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people: 10.880665879716604

i am afraid you will be angry: 9.770709181520614

for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey: 8.487790702735957

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer: 6.252442680179771

there could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr: 9.447463174500934

bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man: 8.768287334787685

the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine: 10.382918825134542

that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly: 7.216427064306939

could there be finer symptoms: 4.259629614139935

but now it was all too natural: 10.3717086774295

it is impossible that he should still love me: 12.126268426336

now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table: 20.701426939698315

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham: 11.33497408663383

her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it: 9.270619384861693

she will make him a very proper wife: 7.408572669120968

it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs: 5.430715757889099

care of him: 6.294374988537395

unfortunately an only son for many years an only _child_ i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own: 8.404100465535016

i am sure you will be very comfortable there: 9.190775317284524

do you talk by rule then while you are dancing: 8.28378222697447

their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten: 9.496796795554367

darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole: 12.952314124882559

it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire: 8.893072577264038

collins was settled _near_ her family: 7.786494674835566

only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me: 10.487188442821438

she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it: 9.388696011825802

unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do: 7.625353011250474

dining out said mrs: 4.4392223171299605

bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn: 10.215842869884451

long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself: 15.114013566084868

if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs <NUM>: 9.21743673539273

the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year: 8.542148198569972

i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire: 15.06645121737939

gracechurch street monday august <NUM>: 12.95944522661397

but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded: 7.0435788879437835

_she_ will not be able to help calling: 11.479395162100928

bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments: 6.868394859646281

among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous: 6.370756531745751

nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility: 8.095191111756746

my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me: 7.341133868095125

i have sir: 10.810812877288853

darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it: 6.131934103864359

collins wants to marry lizzy: 7.168099721812669

james s had made him courteous: 32.2735276993551

it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one: 6.63677498556349

he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting: 8.237666891912198

bingley met them with hopes that mrs: 8.796796582143312

more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed: 7.550549244219136

she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses: 9.602761716416891

their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach: 8.958825023144291

bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned: 10.239962040655893

lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts: 9.177601199580714

i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister: 10.203097350409982

she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents: 9.087834045680022

and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time: 9.330415980577667

i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise: 14.969825389484887

the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes does it: 6.810438916646481

undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation: 6.563784027895454

they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister: 12.931203477318794

_her_ mind was less difficult to develope: 8.146927523008323

and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead: 13.125456450595244

the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay: 9.58319693784106

collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness: 7.603699558426869

but how did he account for it: 8.199694600155379

a few weeks he believed: 28.3111801000718

allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged: 6.952691154849289

collins sat for some time without speaking to any body: 5.857724936689297

bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend: 8.031275996629377

i hope she will turn out well: 6.951032516793142

i cannot understand it: 7.198498604656447

darcy s steward and of _that_ i can assure you he informed me himself: 11.824172969253672

is not he a charming man: 26.724442992278384

that he should even speak to her was amazing: 11.5203764990658

let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr: 9.033256289763782

wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family: 9.54185958488099

in a doleful voice mrs: 6.92302256567196

when mrs: 7.971813192019905

caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself: 7.232864769344139

you are mistaken: 25.95984541836227

in spite of having been at st: 11.25721492516911

elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately: 13.09212026378006

i am far from attributing any part of mr: 11.379078091893907

my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request: 9.18089649088781

if i were as rich as mr: 5.543217499354421

bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it: 9.478914782804647

bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about: 14.360648961547259

but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about: 12.697082007721209

when at length they arose to take leave mrs: 9.064206479485813

she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself: 7.754927621373161

you are so strange: 13.73434700879564

i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing: 8.060557615429143

well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle: 11.556936936680737

the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred: 9.222297114093134

bennet s best comfort was that mr: 6.749936531990929

i shall like it of all things: 12.474863023002454

elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation: 8.655306229382601

why did not you all learn: 8.555589571277

yes thought elizabeth _that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once: 8.522690741785048

collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state: 10.831261305391525

it pains me to offend you: 6.82793753050623

colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express: 5.442215068920233

i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family: 8.188888896013413

while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner: 7.6339024634164785

is not it so mrs: 8.47864803707956

poor jane: 8.80389707944901

we now come to the point: 5.838437078837173

he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling: 8.489751793700385

not the slightest: 10.413160328122306

i wonder what he can be doing there: 9.914086374616067

who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him: 8.037429613608992

on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks: 7.212277346700157

bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property: 6.8503843967500355

i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better: 7.302234065337852

how can you talk so: 16.327305772914098

in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr: 7.405585370746022

cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable: 6.015979669052329

i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard: 5.581781865830796

but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted: 8.523811847698827

the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund: 17.11116262402116

it was a subject which they could not mention before me: 7.453159836309618

bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them: 17.673980861568833

but you are always giving _her_ the preference: 7.4197462393018085

his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing: 8.749603568126744

she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door: 8.110154180585159

georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved: 8.383729136678566

at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other: 8.356413983665481

she was ashamed to think how much: 8.286963248203367

he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been: 7.148931276498399

wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister: 13.341286961452862

they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him: 8.614218591158185

my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last: 8.888614349846351

within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day: 8.378990890622388

balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters: 8.225978691215701

my dear jane: 45.064980818157565

the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work: 10.986461886126737

you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane: 10.523055513058182

you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham: 9.412370075815382

they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering: 7.137217121435137

to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he _did_ i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr: 9.222607965317511

i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness: 10.217091002105182

she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains: 7.111546691884653

no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr: 9.140240719496825

i never heard that it was: 5.108896768503738

i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say: 7.63851688103118

darcy has not made him just to you: 10.11658749382144

in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room: 7.3862300307084245

your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable: 7.50423367300463

he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling: 7.777252833402776

though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession: 5.93679657716472

wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s: 8.653134312705768

in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron: 7.32414693054428

bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr: 7.178645880584537

lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr: 10.807576092654061

the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so: 5.693480152317136

the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence: 8.695925425783905

affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where: 6.189428463051814

but she is too much like her brother very very proud: 7.875472607654536

my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education: 7.560437679836762

i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me: 7.4087897690768925

collins must excuse me: 7.208285694909071

she could think of nothing but of mr: 4.502508470459904

is this to be endured: 5.994257653598748

it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr: 15.425960475867363

and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently: 6.764578832986403

i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being: 8.448247450403601

bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests: 10.31659821084016

the first week of their return was soon gone: 11.135009434373305

i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier: 13.03974944002425

books oh: 4.797141785693573

this is quite shocking: 6.216446140585722

a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern: 16.32181535690792

the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention: 9.108909213052046

if he fears me why come hither: 6.936621887619525

lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind: 9.969028344405064

darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport: 7.994589469060677

it is just as he chooses: 5.6712639136798675

with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round: 8.879093422803065

come darcy said he i must have you dance: 16.903637025916602

to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations: 10.127991867489223

she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down: 11.736313391750274

but upon my honour i do _not_: 6.805566157560544

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened: 12.297601237897252

yes there is nothing in that: 5.513181993046267

do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified: 12.555361465713885

but the clothes the wedding clothes: 7.547050131770982

your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct i am sure: 6.264475895395117

it must be an amusing study: 7.261581228878524

our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character: 8.424250035127358

gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy: 7.936075407789374

she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before: 10.344405624931063

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing: 9.477932782628642

lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless: 5.547867782174179

a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe: 8.41972540247312

bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters: 12.444349407887604

it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire: 8.915373474233517

lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age: 6.862071469335772

and men take care that they should: 13.028221211922538

she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary: 8.520274633162906

at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs: 12.83474014010806

i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk: 6.723358065341239

i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company: 12.908611349254995

but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule: 9.879435365754343

his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else: 9.75896251396085

in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation: 7.647071744559868

did it said he did it _soon_ make you think better of me: 15.28025444735943

my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible: 12.27985444447001

neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr: 11.039827067945213

she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter: 7.8382622415685885

i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve: 6.204700049662787

he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her: 8.703617451573427

if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it: 6.2699517483762355

jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved: 7.203105252001369

jane shook her head: 21.11099670139432

is not general incivility the very essence of love: 8.326835322349178

have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin: 7.937176885660355

i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate: 7.119136400626868

younger sons cannot marry where they like: 8.146927523008324

at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr: 13.851799762375528

i _will_ leave him to himself: 8.210119171623022

miss bennet still looked all amazement: 6.658133511368227

this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr: 6.884996984003066

bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken: 14.372879059780809

to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection: 11.725477302233783

this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make: 8.172429678993856

it will pass away soon enough: 13.453366905248185

wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs: 9.702202820885034

into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance: 7.751877843210846

but are you pleased jane: 10.07335136444759

on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband: 15.413439709559793

i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not: 8.172474534113213

i began to be afraid you would never come back again: 15.923453281474865

wickham and the officers mr: 14.115829356416413

i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more: 11.580838950627074

elizabeth was forced to go: 8.899608001059079

bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure: 7.312192062258045

he owns it himself without disguise: 6.926544671891051

you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing: 7.717049314236428

upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty: 9.652804343517666

bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood: 13.164125015386787

i wonder that the very pride of this mr: 7.355186314880756

could i expect it to be otherwise: 5.749023652937045

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say: 13.327107964335495

you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour: 9.058270236729753

when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party: 7.009054208108636

her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr: 10.316794251811228

aye so it is cried her mother and mrs: 9.17110166515642

darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her: 10.001178572086602

collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair: 8.230937760149995

elizabeth now began to revive: 10.716637281256576

_that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness: 8.673184109712222

are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do: 5.24617977667093

but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did: 10.467040886615406

there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance: 10.138975400261463

philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs: 7.818942473314397

darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match: 8.252757675780646

the party did not supply much conversation: 6.328883746222394

bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle: 10.971683655681275

she did not choose it said her daughter she would go: 9.174029710827147

wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her: 8.3704337745833

collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs: 7.2575208119364545

bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield: 8.215859121155079

philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy: 7.749051940617243

i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring: 8.06528811076342

from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl: 9.04689167791609

my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr: 7.332760823096314

upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock: 7.321437729177136

perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease: 8.352506775346964

i am not afraid of you said he smilingly: 18.191474676250717

my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable: 6.792657500312564

what a stroke was this for poor jane: 9.884808501160576

whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment: 8.325755872777535

darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain: 7.9860216095229895

design: 4.243243607058394

she will be taken good care of: 9.556201723102923

did not you: 12.829785859106238

well then you need not be under any alarm: 23.110015394209018

though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit: 7.481790084590935

bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day: 9.20810306714415

fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance: 8.413528587052076

i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection: 8.946209128704508

every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites: 7.498089880115514

if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful: 10.895318218543604

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park: 12.280911125369403

it is really too distressing: 13.867177032508266

i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl: 16.07370170031633

i told my sister philips so the other day: 6.993260631638684

gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party: 14.305893935125374

i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence: 9.107793207459398

as for the gentleman himself _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence: 9.053038016813275

no i believe not: 22.143318865809224

you are then resolved to have him: 7.384473877706886

many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair: 11.88901030159528

a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing: 9.030496616548422

my dear brother replied mrs: 12.160007970533202

nothing that she could say however had any influence: 4.26410949691845

my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family: 9.111375317136508

that is very strange: 15.749533005615056

collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family: 6.387882891391427

i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner: 9.437908166871562

bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual: 7.1938003476058565

we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy: 8.975320416667238

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us: 14.746744343249949

an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure: 5.469810870340181

they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families: 6.143617402200755

we never had any governess: 6.7760426063250785

it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind: 11.663891629462745

her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone: 7.693717393688828

the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts: 8.112720517670667

she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either: 8.54829309404595

miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room: 8.542628400660059

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune: 9.162498068523613

i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr: 5.552295440718781

it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account: 9.654421688861873

i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses: 10.536170055232605

my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight: 9.977507386331196

the park was very large and contained great variety of ground: 8.541237522303561

perhaps he thought her too young: 4.5997394061151065

she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid: 7.275516625379948

bingley comes my dear said mrs: 12.553953959313189

miss bennet do you know who i am: 5.204761250066528

how i long to see her again: 11.628258055519927

he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr: 10.852757794303148

bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr: 7.581185515341109

who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing: 5.084731372228553

darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son: 9.900623630440554

she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct: 7.283180865025315

the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas: 17.787037079155933

bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love: 14.800921912503215

well: 13.039215662688358

it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us: 5.620887650804522

how i wanted you: 20.535810239019497

and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley: 8.067364359777725

i have every reason in the world to think ill of you: 6.14632862380891

my visit was not long as caroline and mrs: 5.85627598296093

they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are: 11.066565027796425

forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make _me_ your confidante: 9.180190655420146

what i have to say relates to poor lydia: 10.977055414483864

bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library: 11.276391947379265

as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females: 8.118274607468358

sir william did not say much: 14.553374832538294

he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend: 8.63015941483948

elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them: 8.781661181801816

but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is: 10.832653732170355

your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come: 9.60395225967859

but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs: 5.905940414054202

for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials: 8.521330353446627

collins was eloquent in her praise: 8.85557963403415

she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr: 15.373429629703708

can this be mr: 6.396364891339011

unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring: 8.20984146865188

her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies: 10.572106407240572

it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance: 8.25062710407499

bennet could not have chosen better: 4.324461310476043

however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <URL> you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form: 9.70942231788913

pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr: 14.392779381571655

gardiner smiled: 8.828820282679262

collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly: 8.15258861896783

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow: 13.68301375390241

gardiner though unknown: 7.450059943580257

jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail: 16.103563800562085

darcy by coming in all this state to hear me: 10.179088642290852

charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen: 9.68005410741973

gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else: 8.812651649072684

what could your ladyship propose by it: 11.568732251919569

i do not get on at all: 6.753672075146589

darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress: 9.122423267336528

poor eliza: 4.236105288769432

good bye: 16.019500588518518

she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night: 8.533922751433485

bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard: 9.285395038479715

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences: 6.468313475052652

i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished: 5.836723903614591

bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication: 10.019895606996672

elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old: 11.99966336604096

elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere: 12.86141236200289

bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party: 10.784052895861183

the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr: 6.862122745939544

he deserves to be publicly disgraced: 6.926544671891051

now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy: 6.847850862816723

his words seemed to imply it: 8.03547393802938

jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said mr: 4.97951482782039

i do not think we were speaking at all: 9.687566645902912

she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin: 12.198732759346523

but make a virtue of it by all means: 8.851014360220915

thought she: 9.969899159196563

we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr: 7.4304647049374495

i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled: 17.0962388379486

i came to try you: 13.933586389518728

let me know every thing that i am to know without delay: 5.799474599554947

collins made his declaration in form: 7.13810733376028

i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age: 9.573623561895866

your affectionate friend lydia bennet: 8.760242201601136

darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light: 8.738260538495132

they were therefore to go: 16.324450760220962

for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn: 7.862258505703326

wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening: 7.355002585090443

i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had: 8.864389030932285

wickham s attentions: 7.7602535395427195

gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly: 9.93498581303028

many stared: 2.9564699844464166

the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn: 8.75752911956601

but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family: 13.751175986613429

but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs: 10.087615443045452

well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know: 6.739202968138085

this letter is from mr: 10.917126953566184

if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity: 8.294959025829666

he cannot know what mr: 10.629150756188968

you must learn some of my philosophy: 6.595731438531458

other schemes too came into her head: 14.887044027777904

gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication: 8.556247826633724

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected: 10.859075068089375

lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now: 11.531122196180414

what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening: 8.539038313521853

your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together: 11.472465636130252

the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs: 9.447338846307415

it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living: 9.137682459630748

bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it: 8.927930754427289

i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it: 8.066269356008604

it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up: 5.410407759889515

sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves: 7.245937685822253

i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses: 6.0085567134522035

darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him: 15.15075989055707

i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn: 5.523324420205441

bingley urged mr: 7.702523635731165

elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain: 6.339590053825191

see <URL> <HASHTAG> n23 mode 2up transcriber s note text enclosed by underscores is in italics _italics_: 6.213076156236657

your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us: 13.249833085803335

upon the whole i am much pleased with him: 12.388733827774491

you are very cautious i suppose as to its _being created_: 7.630555254894148

gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection: 8.175667018620992

they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants: 8.084977346413229

their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had _she_ been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure: 9.056202512377945

she approached and saw the likeness of mr: 5.517910938514962

had the late mr: 8.607373482441226

lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation: 6.209923890957862

i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball: 7.8227642757770335

your ladyship wants mr: 14.834339681613594

what should not you mind: 12.356372189101382

and so it does i vow: 6.723445243760754

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty: 8.241414200161667

that mr: 8.518183194943742

bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw: 5.786760283421267

with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield: 6.41312083048678

she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more: 8.248940031201458

it is almost past belief: 6.010255877053237

calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly: 6.452027501501274

my mind was more agreeably engaged: 10.891323545623456

they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring: 8.703204945168128

i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point: 10.040410415377442

i can easily believe it: 18.2706214131138

can it be possible that he will marry her: 10.758251954136043

and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject: 11.661725977972749

yet he knew to the contrary himself: 7.708800857231371

they followed her into the dining parlour: 16.401446019642453

elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance: 7.668181242566941

only look at her: 5.80033160001726

sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty: 7.85184828260752

gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn: 8.935797130887916

i wish i could see her: 16.471418102888123

in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist: 10.225556904566728

she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them: 8.31343430307701

he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others: 14.284881769508832

bingley s love: 5.22956752647679

darcy only entered the room: 12.798127203005292

she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room: 8.90626843835657

this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part: 8.505875477942585

can you deny that you have done it: 8.167961396679232

he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly: 14.63911831823504

that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible: 8.5784528457386

collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance: 8.088076781682236

bennet and nothing can clear mr: 5.421359745440075

how mr: 7.822663686466881

he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted: 9.784239836851345

not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them: 9.53030083060353

wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him: 8.03983731067057

pray do not talk of that odious man: 10.220098006865756

i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted: 7.388431723746137

bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age: 11.56587513163832

you supposed more than really existed: 7.095147396313899

my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace: 7.9363718329726245

i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit: 8.184949961491062

_he_ shall be mercenary and _she_ shall be foolish: 7.911119380070734

darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public: 8.3150339957207

what a letter is this to be written at such a moment: 12.698678764912152

i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written: 18.058959908079675

i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied: 5.406004125636204

you must not suspect me: 14.116204601990919

he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry: 7.499911337686324

upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration: 7.281950089513404

one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight: 11.515018635754044

my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be: 12.208426535582744

surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement: 11.51644873226731

yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again: 10.29424665391483

it must not be thought of: 9.333741770730219

you must not blame my aunt: 18.61923559056669

the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen: 12.638003930963025

your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr: 11.930582562066222

come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly: 10.741656864057086

the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them: 7.596784397143483

and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment: 8.216488302108102

said she as she looked in her face: 9.314921474366558

her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank: 8.566375345660344

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr: 9.622440368281175

i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking: 9.93121730408076

all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road: 6.391908968009362

yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded: 12.195495118265743

you _are_ a gentleman s daughter: 9.481116943372614

she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion: 10.33994380714465

the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary: 7.944614908299199

wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family: 9.67672445359961

in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone: 9.116485171101834

they had long wished to see him: 8.171892962843678

wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish: 7.015262988558801

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr: 9.034156638500276

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she: 8.788182075013271

you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him: 12.687322973779203

there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement: 8.82859349097327

not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise: 10.499810332668115

we must not make him desperate: 5.382997193770347

he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way: 7.487276908566221

the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr: 14.63863853921939

i know no harm of her: 13.700688503413177

darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject: 8.996669857048142

did mr: 8.011069412997815

said he smiling: 3.1955532996705087

certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of _them_: 7.148306795060088

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility: 8.857321024896262

never sir: 7.187621002040721

there is nothing like dancing after all: 7.224643621968954

darcy s steward: 24.076293995605063

collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr: 8.918228886921858

bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him: 7.462127020270371

but whatever may be the sentiments which mr: 14.476651194219247

collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary: 10.149901605868285

gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance: 7.21721178268205

it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening: 8.540001855926462

she enquired after his sister but could do no more: 13.508849231395786

if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go: 9.520057927318309

the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth: 10.133561388981366

collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness: 5.383899390023359

i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here: 10.002071268569798

oh lydia: 9.007970174854602

i hope we may often meet again: 6.49763148362459

he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention: 10.578917228664372

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them: 7.682292269094115

let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied: 7.994800196676473

his father miss bennet the late mr: 21.69598805634719

perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers: 7.953957610653222

elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home: 9.137892945196016

her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others: 8.675182500750575

letters of business too: 5.423343895167184

something very much to the purpose of course: 21.93048255111979

miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side: 13.220327670132104

her answer was warmly in his favour: 10.770121687560339

she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else: 6.533301864779886

donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations: 7.48288096677924

i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good: 6.946180599527561

she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth: 8.920397932052158

he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner: 13.753384111055523

but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house: 9.442778531872706

he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention: 8.885114111832852

in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived: 21.311873316965375

it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied: 8.345248357108336

by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy: 5.7933311586050555

i am perfectly convinced by it that mr: 8.395485989168886

colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman: 9.255350121052974

wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited: 9.063913846914797

here comes hill: 4.674559168733217

i am sick of them all: 17.6140081452131

gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it: 14.109678643666152

jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her: 7.597076270099082

they are gone off together from brighton: 8.28380273165078

what say you mary: 13.606092666221464

<NUM> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark and any other party distributing a project gutenberg tm electronic work under this agreement disclaim all liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal fees: 8.61685977819962

as she pronounced these words mr: 7.667682801322143

i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former: 14.080065172184321

but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it: 16.044980989825184

darcy but let me not interrupt you sir: 15.370928632221194

my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts: 25.517463384142985

the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic: 9.930819707252901

miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully: 14.691474087122305

darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice: 11.494990008692621

said jane: 3.1539767363673956

the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies: 8.904182045073279

it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man: 9.992034417660186

nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant: 7.533096837940396

and that said mrs: 5.918713878899648

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_: 11.866940825084415

i do not recollect that we did: 11.592307076624186

it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud: 12.083311339695014

i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you: 12.019683181077621

our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly: 8.193357645826744

he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it: 13.148420521360235

lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house: 8.352496172164876

you are very ill: 5.241116217618948

any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <NUM>: 5.6820337267238505

no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection: 7.7793106643847105

bennet could hardly comprehend it: 7.950764775634656

if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning: 7.199302035765929

it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor: 9.87293770402985

neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane: 17.615513625333477

darcy s but you shall do as you chuse: 9.417897611980555

lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars: 8.759785941813073

i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle: 7.163535971264416

collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character: 7.586780902056289

on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago: 11.650132388829833

gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion: 22.803609378195613

i can recal nothing worse: 5.213275443144346

elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name: 8.72001145404021

darcy looked up: 6.746303706969259

when i am in company with him i will not be wishing: 12.077973611399038

next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky: 9.605050047175428

in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other: 7.072243965837054

let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor: 7.3119047162937

did you see him while you were at lambton: 7.994346682079173

she directly replied you need not be frightened: 11.604528777284301

miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present: 11.101612724228914

elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit: 7.854371301231022

she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him: 10.424052954583658

hurst looked at her with astonishment: 11.499152513548804

if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud: 11.600255679723558

yes madam all: 7.991693807031013

you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday: 8.291777090643306

she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah: 6.1697517306906775

you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us: 11.536444742597876

i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice: 7.841887700941715

it was melancholy to leave her to such society: 8.241782966971373

they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them: 20.45894928018069

no more have i said mr: 9.51369520662113

a person may be proud without being vain: 8.052023525823586

james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look: 11.083093012364046

could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related: 7.354797381373728

he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character: 8.342466368650094

the farewell between herself and mr: 7.640012286872811

but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley: 7.136524753936047

collins you must marry: 15.615655094629023

upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation: 9.5043657237417

bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh: 7.579959280384672

there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us: 9.431288623609337

but that is not the case _here_: 22.72445624989528

she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there: 8.34487249762535

elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last: 11.909647375795192

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy: 9.02374765813214

her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect: 9.016341255849657

you used us abominably ill answered mrs: 9.795803397796952

i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone: 12.59523766208415

mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them: 8.814334552181723

bennet one communication would therefore do for all: 9.260208440871066

elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley: 8.007903934184226

they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world: 6.4342402060275115

i do not see what right mr: 8.374641553120204

when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr: 6.76560723645009

it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr: 10.137232033263595

darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing: 8.547054820033674

collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state: 8.731610712311475

my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself: 16.44211321704129

i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself: 8.414597163873937

see paragraph <NUM>: 6.319835310918291

they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea: 6.665591108329042

but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever: 9.440549699960542

my feelings will not be repressed: 9.372608422503992

it is what every body says: 12.715811835277698

he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility: 7.190430676485589

why is not every body as happy: 9.300264808814974

since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design: 6.848560804669907

his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs: 12.063329205766037

she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention: 8.079207546740244

elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time: 7.422275564282843

and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean: 9.034719956532406

bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls: 8.524763729464146

will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties: 7.3899055661365045

the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging: 6.983476884814159

he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company: 8.924556370443002

wickham ought not to be a clergyman: 11.683407889753608

of music: 5.255610217846075

was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table: 27.65218209193593

she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when: 10.296903208708148

i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to _you_ or to any person so wholly unconnected with me: 8.940647154480542

he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on: 10.427167827848628

collins began: 7.350719077955638

illustration dove dale pride prejudice: 5.2036410617337765

this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune: 6.486719341833471

probably not but mr: 4.9917934265095765

he takes them now for people of fashion: 9.282476542884877

day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs: 10.300352886782507

he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal: 5.888337367179859

every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight: 12.211799656416089

collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh: 8.98493416745295

john told us mr: 5.423343895167184

she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found: 9.599802464865187

bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection: 12.27372364910125

but really i know not what to say: 5.09578342963042

but i suppose you had no opportunity: 18.6751900823035

the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do: 6.754558565225693

my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life: 9.325954448365152

how nicely we are crammed in: 7.94422461683853

my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr: 11.807762009685446

about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged: 11.147424249371223

why must their marriage be private: 6.692657234117397

it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected: 6.987753617194977

philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house: 9.109889682771993

all: 2.8430039810547956

caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter: 7.4854634077173

yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever: 13.72366145150789

philips s manners and politeness: 6.009777079097123

she certainly did not hate him: 6.6391704380688985

forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked: 8.072318927887403

bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel: 7.692527541115448

if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there: 8.407854604417075

they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland: 9.451327589336866

what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant: 7.509134397261791

he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided: 17.947701987450618

she had a sister married to a mr: 11.358155672659693

kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step: 7.99451690987743

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex: 8.118992309049121

but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it: 9.745907574814538

it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it: 5.912570732867617

her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business: 8.038791527541143

when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared: 7.65861531947065

collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman: 7.521685736637741

four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him: 6.330151350452955

it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned: 8.094536088764823

what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr: 7.335437266199953

but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected: 15.670256893464444

and so is it quite certain he is coming: 6.779598814222405

when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give: 12.240683998326585

her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment: 8.59873284319186

but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due: 8.869496657230439

you have a sweet room here mr: 10.201360656858418

have a little compassion on my nerves: 7.7708997769635895

of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough: 8.236035103271522

for the liveliness of your mind i did: 4.73367053184349

nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them: 8.671009484011972

she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken: 16.1104685625014

i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister: 7.322263261841264

and having to relate such a thing of his sister: 7.819054759258243

nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning: 12.133124591572589

what an agreeable man sir william is mr: 17.873423328819094

her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome: 8.576682912217606

he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family: 7.793411160451022

had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place: 5.059885264967904

i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more: 13.546545935897653

how was that possible: 13.53927428409244

he is gone to my father already: 10.005503694506126

gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education: 7.442777330655207

her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr: 8.907630317654217

the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers: 7.424553713757311

my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him: 11.870167752480292

gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head: 13.296583146857449

bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others: 8.897802672087971

i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together: 9.428685345082975

the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs: 8.327331114940941

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur: 9.38133304906656

well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day: 16.196286300529408

darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency: 10.008498228480597

i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced: 5.789671787300107

chapter xiii: 9.682865003888603

for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation: 9.22940401605936

no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both: 10.10697063034047

bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood: 10.70505106587344

she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley: 11.65823461075008

wickham no i certainly am not: 11.411640320784121

i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family: 11.441054524623606

i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs: 8.398196844490121

one came from her books and the other from her toilette: 4.985858834295693

darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result: 7.444536975760366

but it must not shall not be: 6.077583189564446

excellent parsonage house: 5.163608515151185

it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment: 7.53767828037386

i have heard much of your master s fine person said mrs: 6.492984192057083

and she rose as she spoke: 6.692121140213199

darcy s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient and she read it again: 15.507143532421725

miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane: 15.730101134021346

indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me: 9.348719269144723

elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little: 7.972118191720723

for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr: 12.932567056832637

adieu to disappointment and spleen: 8.531764542776658

to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house: 7.958816123832931

shall you like to have such a brother: 10.819256501851624

this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day: 9.076712196369074

i hope not: 6.966581438270336

it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year: 6.861447895120565

what would i give to hear your strictures on them: 15.263208556545628

i am not likely to leave kent for some time: 9.519316124175585

not one party or scheme or any thing: 17.931517862122085

and pray may i ask: 6.042795948251164

are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this: 5.160414738406421

she says lizzy had better have taken mr: 6.302219127158152

collins was to attend them at the request of mr: 6.27690723461868

darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture: 11.833644446840648

bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while: 9.559359156319896

make haste and come down this moment: 9.853919605545252

the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained: 9.495845971588535

elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long: 14.536519524157411

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr: 8.645748402126111

it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions: 7.399777418247736

i am perfectly satisfied: 6.484678156248946

read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about: 11.305709851549777

philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before: 7.429271758042596

lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way: 11.914895274745431

gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr: 8.770971825666033

allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place: 7.6292307300205335

and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr: 6.997040423561707

then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr: 10.328194548981173

but why mr: 5.7704919498052645

collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor: 8.812720189532095

fairbanks ak <NUM>: 5.163608515151185

we must have mrs: 4.88869986637569

collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte: 10.432988904272856

he leaves out half his words and blots the rest: 6.586466962017948

why will you think so: 9.27481561869991

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs: 12.718010113338288

teaze him laugh at him: 8.531764542776658

they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose: 9.783999651897608

her hair so untidy so blowsy: 7.822930995975447

you may as well call it impertinence at once: 9.040342934898984

he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances: 8.178814220856177

i did not expect such a compliment: 6.083429493515623

how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine: 7.829352185454669

could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts: 6.216266831755742

they are in the same profession you know only in different lines: 7.5016388255442426

it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us: 15.799733459890819

nay said elizabeth this is not fair: 15.006967913379862

u: 4.243243607058394

darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself: 7.495743632078135

first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room: 9.553444071792809

this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once: 10.049288528222053

i: 5.025081871206632

my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london: 16.295178300798433

email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s web site and official page at <URL> for additional contact information dr: 7.860612781534029

she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour: 8.624868366579447

bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected: 11.035760696487007

collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary: 10.524405256654033

had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you: 7.970069594609002

had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her: 6.254054335897495

let me mend it for you: 5.826159009931466

darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented: 7.2476998271115844

bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr: 8.412291492889187

an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham: 10.860391508626227

i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner: 11.342496342516728

yet why did he come: 12.070360301333503

collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife: 18.747575214475923

he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former: 12.703335608339206

but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used: 9.842424539837323

the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt: 7.290631100601436

i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr: 8.58851957078549

kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room: 6.917714647312715

and one of my own daughters: 18.83819575715639

my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr: 14.479769122097332

he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend: 9.7544844390872

said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply: 9.43707871737363

these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature: 8.908027531249983

he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows: 8.798858531603276

how odious i should think them: 15.652833387904401

the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement: 16.26187070954211

with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself: 7.913175110820365

elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr: 5.1585939779454115

they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to: 8.194794895844536

i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel: 9.685222179325017

that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice: 11.192086628919373

my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else: 6.04362740242076

he is not at all liked in hertfordshire: 10.629669215648205

and yet how many things have happened: 6.2299135000498636

his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal: 14.11982045240923

lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites: 8.684815905626426

and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now: 15.646947894429465

we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun: 6.903080533796293

if you will believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight: 11.386117433889584

pray tell your sister that i long to see her: 7.994180163728566

what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err: 7.972961399604132

gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself: 8.585525918933445

his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice: 8.369097298248672

they have some of the finest woods in the country: 5.984293108935315

she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word: 6.864694302394183

you did: 6.239854649871699

the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side: 7.3593775253448355

at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented: 6.886951514928757

bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed: 11.961331010725381

his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her: 8.444745983599038

a little time therefore: 8.04160637915416

collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed: 9.00538012436822

elizabeth felt jane s pleasure: 7.128383066659207

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was: 7.708017930376125

well lizzy said mrs: 12.673282634882352

denny and mr: 3.556789063458173

bennet could hardly contain herself: 7.950764775634656

there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters: 8.089431768501234

they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr: 11.621543505242375

elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal: 9.51073745145012

no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it: 9.424643663141431

the room in which the ladies sat was backwards: 8.395389860069216

he has _some_ friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves: 6.03384165870103

the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw: 12.786536250109103

reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master: 6.748417742240924

the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke: 10.673134702035238

but we are all liable to error: 5.852033592844042

but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable: 9.162201780754447

wickham and herself: 10.60131961179661

their table was superlatively stupid: 4.38403703338987

come kitty i want you up stairs: 19.652574149046288

i thought we never should have got into the coach: 6.603518334175414

special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg tm concept and trademark: 12.17106385939257

do your sisters play and sing: 12.472647748743363

elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more: 9.20664494230963

wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant: 7.143709298655639

tis too much: 4.639762344081459

what do you mean hill: 11.560739354008657

her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious: 15.319822547799738

having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business: 10.007064043998758

i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news: 7.475688713705457

the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground: 8.50126918015793

this was a lucky idea of mine indeed: 11.031105069477322

one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn: 12.194941586332718

i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh: 6.228724174513677

darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once: 8.875556395751666

bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball: 13.973871340047987

there was no want of discourse: 13.958632868474558

any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far: 7.673995307943187

elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together: 12.200993218695602

i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you: 5.99866551036787

he is nothing to us you know and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again: 7.971241742191505

in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere: 9.633246631577041

i must not decide on my own performance: 7.727011244629865

since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy: 8.214827835584062

to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate: 7.830002069651489

elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible: 6.516961932167923

what a pity it is mamma we did not all go: 7.271817632925012

darcy who sat opposite to them: 12.335171252588147

once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear: 9.861988558868543

on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must: 12.855968114987082

may i ask to what these questions tend: 7.09983835606331

i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her: 10.705373873966149

it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long: 16.931484781626114

while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr: 6.856833805438854

the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants: 9.539906563714782

you have delighted us long enough: 10.706211639256875

bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies: 8.535218558833233

your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence: 10.177501308078803

it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single: 6.632270260795543

the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual: 12.72527030412162

she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness: 10.982330366690512

one must speak a little you know: 4.306670076578738

i never can be thankful mr: 6.953459746179746

he seldom appeared really animated: 6.92581633738307

poor little lizzy: 8.392806878795902

darcy may hug himself: 6.0514512668250715

that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home: 12.616611037907767

he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away: 9.170980183959621

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home: 7.994940403717528

she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse: 7.243855334320561

it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man: 8.67065937725706

but my dearest love tell me what dish mr: 10.185857644984521

lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr: 15.172435933189352

it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling: 6.872192296595452

miss bingley i am sure cannot: 13.924778569869584

everything wore a happier aspect: 5.616830422948574

all young ladies accomplished: 4.4392223171299605

gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face: 10.413440042219598

there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping i dare say: 6.084875669471493

there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste: 8.29765237499551

bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them: 14.818846082049536

but no one can throw any blame on them: 17.215462434376345

bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter: 9.012122168826405

mary and kitty were both with mrs: 11.447918318871313

bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance: 8.293669532620877

clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish: 6.131288237709374

one does not know what to think: 13.812001268896521

how much you must have gone through: 8.805092476946973

we acted with the best intentions: 4.71361977266926

they must all go to brighton: 26.932783017089285

darcy is uncommonly kind to mr: 9.083531730542372

they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable: 11.290735771044238

wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once: 11.304362155102632

i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town: 17.189577096189932

and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information: 10.832978778660397

what do you keep winking at me for: 5.763783581217342

she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable: 8.145206943931038

i should infinitely prefer a book: 5.261386761889512

why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold: 8.177951026585955

very true my dear that is exactly what i say: 5.755540169122956

he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard: 9.260003842402844

darcy can please where he chuses: 6.753979838362806

but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her: 7.58937831719757

you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind: 9.361685766701484

it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour: 9.263033083931306

from what can it proceed: 9.246782340188137

you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage: 7.946463608385313

in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him: 8.41638550951706

she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another: 8.699902775662135

he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before: 10.20982790650851

you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night: 7.634477100762658

shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers: 24.428446207554806

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all: 10.057134283963988

but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice: 8.356129320166646

when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for: 9.178341322259755

and with a bow to mr: 7.882325531757642

the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone: 7.988752417693649

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends: 8.245650833331581

let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence: 9.93652095216668

wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs: 5.506202081932857

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c: 6.4095346626360366

he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done: 10.104863633535233

they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her: 15.148178702662738

and she was only sixteen last june: 7.024530455137411

it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum: 7.723192017959346

we cannot suppose he would help it if he could: 8.729457990846658

younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what: 9.219938935069218

could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster: 8.940472976032327

two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it: 21.155064518072038

collins s correspondence for any consideration: 5.746694537980914

i am glad he is gone: 14.82126775652389

you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate: 15.659965708006961

it must be my uncle s doings: 7.282354323080457

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation: 11.507479079499927

shall we ask your cousin the reason of this: 18.6175140583719

hill began instantly to express her joy: 14.887044027777904

bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time: 10.30049236771631

you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one: 6.733787833065849

all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum: 10.965421907924

royalty payments must be paid within <NUM> days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns: 8.174318261756904

the tumult of her mind was now painfully great: 18.64797352508808

jane was distressed: 14.705273598143048

from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent: 6.605329205660011

it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well: 10.79201360254383

i am sorry it went off: 11.378267551693007

when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm: 11.813249336617679

but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea: 10.215497405025088

but does not jane correspond with the sister: 9.004771245066669

i believe i have now told you every thing: 15.956056490166683

and to be kept back on _such_ a motive: 8.287820392050946

you have employed your time much better: 6.889063832902656

jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr: 11.855697609408852

i hope there was: 6.960746520905405

you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude: 8.806909337196293

put them next to your great uncle the judge: 7.911119380070734

the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met: 7.510841840035131

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs: 8.113163025294337

how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you: 7.4651495334572235

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room: 9.055188212726204

i will make no promise of the kind: 4.91604613385057

she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening: 6.733211478401842

wickham we are brother and sister you know: 5.977422974526633

darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend: 11.69034763864194

we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word: 6.469116910284785

at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters: 6.732315691590336

as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_: 9.940928294218576

aye that is because you have the right disposition: 13.556556682822524

to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long: 10.728021513579339

darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme: 8.215331525506032

yes she did: 9.15462461425602

darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself: 11.005560795547721

hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr: 14.151032957815012

the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence: 9.157741249815954

she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away: 9.745319859105892

i know we dine with four and twenty families: 5.324741348611916

reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him: 5.393151226754032

he had never had the slightest suspicion: 5.206578908896892

every savage can dance: 3.9276045722070565

darcy had much better finish his letter: 10.820793216032094

how humiliating is this discovery: 8.100481382953326

gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation: 7.2794720707664915

i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips: 9.366492738854644

_that_ is all settled: 25.731235215061904

i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him and _to_ him too freely: 7.627038266291129

at present i am not in love with mr: 9.276548572030027

and do you like her: 23.944864178189377

she will drop the acquaintance entirely: 8.126716785401154

yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly: 8.090023386028088

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr: 7.834128026423033

your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done: 13.08450648692249

the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees: 9.723078541585425

a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter: 12.048443130450464

nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts: 9.166116314562512

he has more to give: 4.816010979150028

a little: 7.441903046464538

darcy had voluntarily done for lydia: 8.561283200518789

i should as soon call her mother a wit: 5.994093924197883

darcy and herself: 5.491182597193749

and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr: 7.196120678884108

there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings: 5.495624617061952

lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on mr: 10.918357553763286

it was only said lately george wickham esq: 5.847301968320008

because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement: 6.189428463051814

the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages: 9.8090540051803

i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one: 14.718357663410002

the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings: 7.154167142002842

you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled: 13.403424583192963

well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss: 9.553845029557118

collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority: 9.109731451176875

he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum: 7.2297894558952605

i can hardly write for laughing: 5.007493032922206

james s with very decent composure: 22.386816202305802

philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin: 9.533820372721337

a young man such as you describe mr: 6.634701720738371

darcy said nothing at all: 9.76610181812046

but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable: 8.684544216997132

edw: 4.243243607058394

do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will: 7.905104952641591

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of: 10.18234182205625

i must be in town next saturday: 7.369592479523027

i am going away myself: 4.309990282385869

bennet sent to mr: 19.29318254255386

after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display: 9.955019968264786

his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time: 8.25782404282939

but georgiana would not join her: 6.668492540526745

two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs: 12.95537236304823

gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days: 8.382465629253577

elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill: 7.1546889369300795

the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth: 6.799525823340719

so much the man of fashion: 17.299969189676734

i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind: 5.404847805831584

by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of: 9.253065697766102

there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him: 9.104199751501456

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr: 12.534945564648678

she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain: 10.647980961259666

he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing: 9.598917579146956

without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first: 9.384780277804623

and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection: 18.599755902464924

your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month: 9.13533870163987

elizabeth was in agonies: 5.124490656200767

now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr: 4.657936480739753

wickham had resolved on quitting the militia: 14.944963638563312

you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous: 8.657567138737816

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted: 9.063030089163869

as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out: 8.455310746138773

wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia: 10.08616415181481

but vanity not love has been my folly: 6.324476467352198

i am so grieved for him: 12.991725859421942

but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s: 12.22728798461891

and pray what sort of guardians do you make: 6.393828916754205

miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense: 8.126749006157757

she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr: 8.4378512722091

the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh: 9.806946066724846

darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this: 11.427839631550702

it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs: 10.184506457982591

your younger sisters must be very young: 10.760439501204498

never mind miss lizzy s hair: 7.058472803659747

bennet made no answer: 9.594089280417375

they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer: 14.908338310161644

nor i i am sure said miss bingley: 11.953843767590925

i have not _that_ pain: 4.753813895484509

wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house: 10.683607385275918

my sweetest lizzy: 7.955375680946605

yes yes they must marry: 11.655436001361917

teazing teazing man: 5.163608515151185

may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study: 8.798478520041483

lizzy said he what are you doing: 10.139471406965672

they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better: 10.063444327341484

she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley: 8.214994886072542

of having another daughter married to mr: 12.168296198504928

you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me: 7.153615896402815

he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear: 30.22378010548027

collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself: 5.966254225487966

with the officers: 5.655812977620532

collins was a most humiliating picture: 12.766477914059482

it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that: 10.382197862627857

bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals: 8.899616133722565

absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr: 6.73779175657646

there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself: 7.324368554958622

is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses: 6.5848068882736355

as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer: 17.48532346800692

elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr: 8.149675083638574

every body is disgusted with his pride: 6.141484371843986

and do you really love him quite well enough: 11.064734331559507

my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england: 8.260664963993973

i have not a doubt of mr: 7.466682281889649

her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered: 8.410154485860339

about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her: 9.552269128587804

miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him: 9.813627131080878

what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have: 7.655886694932314

the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse: 10.367255901920569

a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on: 7.261060117979056

he studies too much for words of four syllables: 11.345294861904552

gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr: 10.223608271616321

i shall certainly try to get the better: 10.055156239846507

their powers of conversation were considerable: 4.642420524986875

darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster: 11.843476408248504

as they drove to mr: 9.379325852065813

no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room: 12.334748589044052

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world: 10.903973012187183

blame you: 4.797141785693573

darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away: 9.330080169363612

not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves: 7.991084154787283

there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome: 7.400477608343925

she will be down in a moment i dare say: 13.273696579049586

she shared in their attendance on mrs: 6.724787684283828

she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage: 10.132066831361739

yet indeed i am in earnest: 6.132691230644169

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs: 9.54992333728447

elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation: 13.203752366633879

they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses: 9.563082047882283

bingley s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham: 6.9389877614741815

bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing: 11.658028209711146

where does discretion end and avarice begin: 4.746395738716702

scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs: 10.27967947589972

now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence: 10.392608198565958

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure: 6.942436031972851

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted: 8.754240860406757

wickham passed all his youth there you know: 6.351536640371704

she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years: 12.455847882157727

but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes: 9.967122397395888

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance: 8.44890403466227

only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time: 9.381149189911085

she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry: 10.679692741363212

but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited: 8.057954619890506

bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia: 9.563058474986391

his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost: 10.136554837645509

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind: 5.964675429511385
