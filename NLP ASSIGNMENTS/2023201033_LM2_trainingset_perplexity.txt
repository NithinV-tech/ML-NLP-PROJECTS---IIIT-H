darcy: 5.138661843959479

mr: 3.2198495402876337

they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room: 10.015206594403228

<NUM> of la belle assemblee <NUM> st july 1815_ pride prejudice: 3.617097342417206

excuse my interference: 11.123143201950244

darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life: 9.191382891036623

could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected: 13.822996612381798

while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning: 6.822847691401429

bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them: 8.330338862074887

it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be: 13.180113569835585

on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs: 7.492015463223239

i do not know: 6.688691510184403

i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company: 8.711945526364186

collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs: 8.066933894729551

mrs: 3.8175662746206735

jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention: 9.985404355768917

we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately: 9.754430098441777

philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr: 11.158831638396137

i hope they will not meet at all: 11.266599672111466

but here he was set right by mrs: 7.949952972288841

she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved: 8.837783145770244

do you not know that such a report is spread abroad: 10.769596980213361

he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring: 9.565047603435533

let her be called down: 8.066117602177977

i see your design bingley said his friend: 7.726486583212967

oh: 4.372841025735526

lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter: 11.383063982088345

you may well warn me against such an evil: 7.9163998028203695

insolent girl: 11.583237676560811

bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him: 10.675902797179212

with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal: 10.744384928019976

lady catherine seemed pleased: 8.555498236887557

her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous: 11.541637785604225

that is as it happens: 13.530168256974962

charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs: 10.086129920409585

he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter: 7.628147124380932

i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be: 12.0235177862009

i depend on you for that: 14.633966269874637

you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters: 10.993375589142019

let wickham be _your_ man: 7.339868416343381

what is his name: 10.27997097182709

you are rather disposed to call his interference officious: 7.928955171954199

dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed: 13.007820651281866

collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother: 8.626365023286983

she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: 9.179415828694202

i have not the smallest hope: 7.335487138009481

she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe: 9.245690898415967

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr: 9.532341983052104

robinson did not i mention it to you: 12.842792859119653

and mrs: 5.067136686927331

the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn: 7.8064770790301505

the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin: 8.63308363916406

hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation: 9.572996771567764

had you then persuaded yourself that i should: 10.936405218245838

yes where else can they be so well concealed: 8.63274505295485

but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence: 8.293515789339834

of what are you thinking: 14.11626059930389

and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail: 8.483105428720103

i see no occasion for that: 9.116424525212267

bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again: 9.803322628866795

in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief: 12.440093812948183

when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel: 8.564217082880628

elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention: 6.078330791653683

darcy has no defect: 10.088622834085614

are quite well: 12.762283536684032

they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea: 10.3407577771608

lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him: 6.383375514130509

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could: 10.659407688692067

but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead: 9.127613417592157

he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere: 11.068952340137152

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs: 6.607626327610509

cried lydia: 10.347158659990269

forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness: 10.056127066659604

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first: 8.655661487021094

one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it: 13.885260974002724

collins all praise of me will be unnecessary: 11.382850131430436

never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting: 10.083694233519703

who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival: 7.33557695768694

darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning: 8.713120473572017

her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return: 8.144841404666536

it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers: 15.074648082827688

perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company: 10.02728227108434

bromley of course: 10.421056128335442

i ought not to have said a word about it: 11.730455115042107

you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing: 11.884473726086428

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt: 10.656002376479147

compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means: 9.608155223333707

but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging: 10.78667890273374

from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink: 14.311423373674131

how long has she been such a favourite: 13.942753621031928

this accounted to elizabeth for mr: 9.26931689301187

even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away: 9.910417485913474

hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves: 7.284392801505314

i am not one and twenty: 7.593186485443787

bingley and his sisters: 10.286561074029727

but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge: 12.488537435201815

elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly: 9.010953477034773

the suspicions which had just arisen of mr: 8.579656565173662

darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs: 7.699812147692602

but i must tell you how it went off: 9.35441587977141

but so they always are: 8.809277852851833

when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs: 10.219884692159313

the supposition did not pain her: 11.681429747414423

their manners are not equal to his: 15.154776000914799

bennet s being quite unable to sit alone: 8.582858156253893

bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen: 12.57245519966962

darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear: 9.16711955376015

how would she have behaved: 8.654619561009273

through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance: 9.004465293220905

certainly not at first: 16.199625052480116

without a governess you must have been neglected: 12.216468036439316

_too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject: 8.195336329353006

she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what: 9.217613131249603

the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it: 11.30037798001097

my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart: 8.458051846284373

yes sir but i do not know when _that_ will be: 10.722601255935386

it must be his own doing: 14.191527526842544

the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr: 10.691922955455025

charles when you build _your_ house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley: 7.901765186248297

i do not at all know but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield: 13.272269274245696

jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians: 8.795835205698724

you do not know what i suffer: 10.006536266572535

in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well: 10.370699083572761

our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money: 7.293084803425403

having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy: 10.017826079158889

since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education: 8.881231510629329

gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror: 9.563410591666344

bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly: 9.93259467714627

the old lady is mrs: 7.986309698298232

and pray when am i to wish you joy: 8.129058336559261

elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter: 9.258235389728661

her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully: 10.244526618931555

darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small: 10.640170694139334

project gutenberg is a registered trademark: 9.913440719422185

and do you really know all this: 9.862650574304581

collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs: 10.529235343963675

it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s: 8.258986292671734

darcy s progress through _his_ book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page: 7.467998706259981

well any friend of mr: 7.441581998680595

why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more: 8.066480472164912

but with _me_ it is not so: 11.67360009741368

hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room: 8.631275886089051

colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body: 9.974021334504512

i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her: 8.327886230226321

in every view it is unaccountable: 13.00806982248557

i know it to be impossible: 12.180581576804967

bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for: 10.848303157307361

my object _then_ replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to: 8.688037684300173

she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended: 7.322658303780871

though i _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you: 10.476526554075384

it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement: 8.367218053451875

her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard: 7.997611864803933

i thank you for explaining it so fully: 8.13787579880587

darcy_ you see is the man: 12.971961697458562

he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him: 7.831809202510799

it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom: 14.00672545843572

i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary: 8.055356972960029

colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton: 8.17866420683918

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs: 10.499211525337483

a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme: 10.65397362411305

they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence: 6.420992265689565

but mr: 6.510209191230928

a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment: 7.056436641526303

how acutely did she now feel it: 8.8167814956082

what is to become of us: 8.2042956125533

she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family: 9.221017210824971

by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself: 10.125448639998472

you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it: 9.010835630582804

darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said _you_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment: 10.229897506805985

my uncle is to send a servant for us: 10.766840160282843

bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr: 9.829901504372069

but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most: 7.032814409351648

allowing for the common demands of the game mr: 12.4982159083134

i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone: 8.278728768450218

he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam: 10.7900675987544

bingley was incomprehensible: 8.33194239112827

she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed: 8.063069985807322

he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton: 12.161441677931997

darcy give you his reasons for this interference: 8.663534564218804

were questions with which she amused herself: 9.781072514229113

she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her: 10.511678027773632

bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life: 15.13676794843551

i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing: 10.348054593738462

your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me: 9.854061835991384

bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them: 7.745372022829524

they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned: 7.004586991673365

and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road: 11.190121434195495

take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one: 11.560813618030403

you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease: 12.34348354746196

i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal: 11.162907316828543

the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other: 7.881916732434995

that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask: 11.396723822160286

darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh: 9.914635930479726

certainly he replied biting his lips: 7.673661087099331

he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners: 11.642188472624786

a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible: 10.377136180966847

why did not you seek legal redress: 7.590233158233685

bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom: 13.9946046907274

i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park: 10.090579841452254

bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr: 7.026332647365414

lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself: 10.816186197193746

lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her: 13.901658144177837

how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr: 8.725187535924986

the commendation bestowed on him by mrs: 7.871618354671876

for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions: 8.449216819195694

that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears: 7.291696172408209

on mr: 9.650232876240159

heaven forbid: 8.963402135494686

these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you: 8.4884249852019

in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage: 9.410983773642995

jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light: 6.621769603928569

they met again on sunday and then _i_ saw him too: 10.461132955658071

i roused and interested you because i was so unlike _them_: 7.7887601386131875

jane was by no means better: 9.730701736240745

if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better: 11.878742692569393

her ladyship was highly incensed: 8.770301804319466

cried elizabeth but how could _that_ be: 10.230791519796325

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer: 11.771435675173295

darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration: 10.078975731607734

and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case: 12.473104485066306

no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation: 11.684694225822327

miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding: 10.552430519381284

yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all: 10.79473701722281

your attendance upon her has been too much for you: 10.870858710437876

many small donations <NUM> to <NUM> <NUM> are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs: 5.087785676251417

you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment: 11.602536242550752

collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him: 7.7999639845524555

louisa you will not mind my waking mr: 8.149353464207923

elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr: 8.37155960775365

i have a high respect for your nerves: 8.810040731758095

cried elizabeth when she had finished: 12.710566716245653

she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all: 11.120110986858796

jenkinson to make up her party: 10.60701830215303

every kind of pride must revolt from the connection: 10.280026204173238

no: 11.891983501820198

pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us: 10.488822837836908

as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go: 11.074775595722873

caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time: 9.661359029523732

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations: 8.886431766424915

gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk: 9.086512548984178

but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham: 8.181633377570146

we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve: 10.980485306941524

bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them: 6.558084477185975

elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied: 7.940259447379406

he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me: 11.1628735739438

lizzy said her father i have given him my consent: 12.166087436503883

after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr: 8.030175325106882

darcy is not to be laughed at: 12.137654378194776

darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr: 8.899898209991905

lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her: 6.582227806192927

i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing: 12.308538566276852

he shook his head: 7.777588603054186

she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr: 7.777338426402891

he is his own master: 13.995178825518444

elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another: 8.780690685107874

<NUM>: 5.188117464510374

she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour: 9.851498341585142

from their infancy they have been intended for each other: 9.858047841151519

well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband: 14.214885501796047

his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative: 9.767215663805729

it must have been his sister s doing: 13.53810239238713

darcy had been at her sister s wedding: 12.264817559820358

you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth: 8.7969133112217

your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry mr: 8.656664919548225

bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord: 5.752982659664499

much as i respect them i believe i thought only of _you_: 11.075912890139977

bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr: 9.20336720637528

i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had: 13.605983907340676

bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs: 8.22500091081746

it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married: 12.566862734873624

i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been: 14.589151087810695

whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully: 10.274537406113096

to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr: 8.127413865390562

she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable: 9.656885742382807

neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance: 8.80750202686335

and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry: 13.61174656065191

vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another: 9.564300184941013

london printed for t: 6.856895314763031

bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations: 11.002255649525896

the happiest wisest most reasonable end: 6.963109059641701

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable: 12.28329126557413

collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family: 12.501567998997002

she was very equal therefore to address mr: 7.144910315358851

and so you like this man s sisters too do you: 8.394716504937692

you need not: 9.846294119583602

he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country: 10.315247782744434

the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough: 9.904447975309239

compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements: 6.538045680737095

collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr: 8.495502975962697

i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom: 12.45543338582693

yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one: 8.286493565545408

she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever: 7.808049238950032

your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather: 7.468767737178405

jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening: 8.399542110363381

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured: 9.654179437574303

much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball: 12.078209307605007

this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it: 9.018861477928189

aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one: 8.87731000902206

is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman: 10.732792620246125

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr: 10.435787544991088

what sort of a girl is miss darcy: 12.664088173582478

i understand that mr: 8.90695237775273

if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement: 7.443929944755779

she comes to us to day: 11.555898533583324

he wrote last week to hurry my return: 6.124714659339456

elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked: 9.891629319180472

elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr: 9.071267118815792

collins instead: 10.710973345760902

he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room: 8.343084845922114

i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her: 7.839535038971764

she liked him too little to care for his approbation: 11.670717932731336

long: 13.32122079646671

but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs: 12.515392565640242

collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many: 7.060203623569691

i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago: 9.051979369396935

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room: 7.317068464838394

he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately: 11.524097483707639

kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill: 8.623989183701665

the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr: 11.583808031881215

well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home: 7.190107137541095

he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else: 11.027481234394855

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken: 8.629488754591554

i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers: 10.71522154724913

she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be: 10.58070163466421

i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away: 5.521775684741331

the moral will be perfectly fair: 11.83969634219379

she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas: 12.161299026531513

on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer: 6.59052375694058

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment: 10.53412251823173

in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy: 10.11287534934224

it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr: 8.30261357647374

when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library: 13.68411535737652

the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident: 10.132739270577364

i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before: 9.208702100966988

are not you curious to hear how it was managed: 14.749410394150917

where where is my uncle: 12.33026807672636

bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before: 9.696620971222401

you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course: 8.85778080181295

bennet that is very unlucky: 11.417413959931414

on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley: 7.885022399068783

catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort: 13.975688554419932

it originated in mrs: 6.907815212340908

she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will _make_ her know it: 9.560073080551362

but i wonder how long you _would_ have gone on if you had been left to yourself: 10.682733636233923

presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on: 8.956483770599121

and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her: 9.292297151372104

collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it: 9.432888684696675

there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming: 12.041729691924491

but these i suppose are precisely what you are without: 9.093122205670987

i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s: 12.76158603342233

i have not been accustomed to such language as this: 7.416893010773764

you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome: 11.846083897443389

their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr: 7.683013950832278

his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret: 11.136014736076

darcy about it if you had rather not: 15.272310431249238

we may compare our different opinions: 6.148630875574865

from his garden mr: 11.253381982773096

they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself: 9.926839139943596

indeed i am: 12.71485148680121

wickham will never marry a woman without some money: 10.152064960593785

i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love said darcy: 8.04040502478791

as she went up stairs to get ready mrs: 9.838741644466165

after a short silence the lady first spoke: 7.679184391413858

without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want: 6.604464297504492

darcy she was directly retreating: 11.45913798038178

they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master madam he is walking towards the little copse: 10.246168548703691

his revenge would have been complete indeed: 9.481607770343567

poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful: 12.486923515318574

yes sir i know i am: 13.419595574635924

it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_: 9.554217724465829

you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last: 9.577449278286139

which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to: 12.600054170904398

other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons: 5.989183867436893

jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed: 6.347857361926125

in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs: 11.134264372578347

it is highly improper: 7.872586487951959

it cannot be: 9.280899019044893

i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr: 9.55156281489969

mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball: 11.909525659273063

after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet: 10.573334852467587

wickham: 7.8104228284598936

elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr: 8.875291784964222

only think of _that_ my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time: 11.824621489395808

bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit: 12.018959486988463

if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to: 10.768279718682557

i do not believe she often sees such at home: 6.428509641307826

how strange: 9.224492424613151

f: 7.427115530702453

she cried: 10.208913524331203

it was agreed to: 9.549260834775753

i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off: 11.44437577060333

i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him: 10.876566492548038

gardiner: 8.113436642672694

on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place: 5.914973462921539

society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body: 7.157259570419758

i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice: 9.742582044306008

darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift: 12.469873910641986

think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure: 8.163903517045568

wickham s attention was caught and after observing mr: 8.134078439669135

robinson: 16.283221878336267

take whatever you like and get away: 7.267503604109676

bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game: 10.123232623476277

i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs: 13.117680132336252

we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect: 9.636161273011883

collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest: 9.956285589558874

he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father: 11.15545454424321

bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr: 6.446997628040578

bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made: 11.323404321306816

collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give: 7.333671871688674

her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented: 9.13867423401629

he only told me what i have now told you: 11.739957638640496

well well and so mr: 12.105547600918234

certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: 8.686323078428181

after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is _your_ turn to say something now mr: 9.520799852329011

most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other: 5.193656941175631

the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected: 9.854170695144736

but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant: 10.966708888036901

the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement: 7.672848062813646

gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent: 4.933035118599296

she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge: 12.105719623033524

the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely: 7.41115004991113

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end: 9.350509044426216

the lucases are very artful people indeed sister: 6.759939439177339

indeed you are mistaken madam: 11.075826384622783

the morrow produced no abatement of mrs: 5.555327951457454

you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time: 9.093074124288325

_you_ cannot have been always at longbourn: 12.285448707818112

younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town: 13.248644294935948

chapter xii: 6.801265390849918

what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand: 7.868125405112851

elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled: 7.043555005380757

hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party: 9.17640457928031

she will follow wherever lydia leads: 6.481778607620101

an hour however saw the whole completed and mr: 9.122940358743598

i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day: 4.504603863137316

you are not well enough you cannot go yourself: 8.324774146156113

there is nothing the matter with me: 7.906867854556711

i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy: 9.128685790697617

i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements: 6.783562942917419

you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir: 9.652407713986179

while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough: 11.259889629684654

how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love: 11.079191743114688

darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections: 10.069525268223302

bennet treated the matter differently: 9.15062633709623

a long dispute followed this declaration but mr: 6.02840397087163

it was first broken by mrs: 6.372421810303134

forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning: 8.45048246380113

but papa is so disagreeable: 9.017839532422911

how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd: 10.199843699719324

there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies: 7.0727238066347

on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided: 9.587888233835553

and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them: 9.580535111376793

how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned: 10.564047229113198

bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence: 7.3885427182975105

i am sure _i_ know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this: 7.988852735915635

what congratulations will then flow in: 7.38850230792365

after a few minutes reflection however she continued i _do_ remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper: 8.230881507138987

and can you likewise declare that there is no _foundation_ for it: 9.014089734651286

we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all: 10.24483852663018

i advise mr: 8.299489939856295

it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it: 11.012553854141299

this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving: 11.488795057774492

i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place: 7.60041212243504

bennet and mrs: 6.911590141517317

and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam do not go: 8.407054636663053

cried jane: 12.942802764301504

but my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_ they are even impartial towards miss king: 7.6347694472911725

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene: 10.105775932882278

for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support: 4.920912968015957

bingley must be down again in the summer: 14.561664996694121

and this is your real opinion: 11.622663359474194

it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all: 8.945532793225437

of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself: 13.936717415042233

he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear: 12.471260293186482

they were able to love each other even as well as they intended: 12.137460114024353

he knows where we live: 9.618291946557843

robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and _which_ he thought the prettiest: 8.477502218963643

no i should have turned in a moment: 12.365254652972476

collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence: 8.075114675243272

bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr: 8.948137425264571

yours ever caroline bingley: 7.668089601649574

and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight: 10.759277243800778

darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr: 11.111544831062655

bennet from fighting: 7.049427205373797

from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them: 9.5758485179448

darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him: 9.277760185612888

mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun: 11.580227956289445

you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner: 14.430406456485777

darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr: 8.447367177609065

she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr: 9.657306619587992

darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding: 9.20606724754798

wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more: 8.545059957024435

fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy: 8.972563212102035

with my mother up stairs: 12.344011670690122

thank heaven: 9.295023646243683

this mrs: 10.277677392617974

from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr: 10.573826444105103

elizabeth was delighted: 10.721249676935031

collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself: 7.035403811849088

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield: 8.873101590755024

he was most highly esteemed by mr: 7.394271501432808

bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters: 10.683982560975032

his pride said miss lucas does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it: 9.242645029483231

he was on one side of her mother: 12.42661730773805

i am prodigiously proud of him: 6.766825002429528

bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on: 11.08468008753103

darcy approaching them and at no great distance: 12.087669001797147

if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark: 11.710206567814922

with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it: 7.252632010843873

it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr: 10.597646292221938

cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr: 9.96061140112703

i have done with you from this very day: 11.739373490549543

they were natural and just: 10.122599144878984

and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty: 12.08996672442959

what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable: 8.2592437000536

elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her: 9.788864966215968

till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance: 14.96814646633277

her power was sinking every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace: 8.44866724696897

bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party: 10.952961477193442

impossible: 18.708066351865114

seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence: 11.029673665502395

i do not believe mrs: 6.999318387151629

my dear mr: 5.819824125785309

no one made any reply: 9.235259291461949

of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd: 7.225164204587858

now lizzy i think i _have_ surprised you: 9.112428732442366

the adieu is charity itself: 5.921470012968549

bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr: 8.02067993622345

two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge: 8.442152577297643

they must have seen them together for ever: 9.949058641596466

information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment: 4.362532912647827

what am i to do: 10.33781398190652

elizabeth went away with her head full of him: 14.484818827168906

colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head: 9.49620457741438

it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution: 7.961327432179801

such a charming man: 11.421736423802306

darcy s regard: 9.17711932247605

philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason: 12.433196372455026

the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks: 10.11613165555272

her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil: 8.257047872240882

well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him: 11.561790032251304

it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before: 9.651650871127309

why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all: 12.744543530960803

oh yes: 7.138890274159456

she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s: 8.567188098244719

i _have_ heard from authority which i thought _as good_ that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron: 9.044302902706807

darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition: 10.473504170759323

at length the parsonage was discernible: 7.025052903429632

you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms: 11.23391203110961

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head: 10.834879658792346

but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes: 12.51538506925751

elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances: 8.589013676139878

i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two: 8.258804118432764

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves: 10.243082015270469

you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour: 9.817217201559265

bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before: 9.85088387985494

gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr: 12.022976729947324

philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence: 10.448170267399007

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men: 9.4644170624944

he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before: 11.88508182343976

i would go and see her if i could have the carriage: 16.023617129477895

you will be a very happy woman: 13.514752830731249

i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr: 9.354767422341606

said he that is rather singular: 11.810822400592189

but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for: 12.496142741022265

i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right: 12.760541865252115

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine: 11.284917780646092

as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence: 7.603710274273179

but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them: 9.6515982683835

not handsome enough to dance with: 12.814938252951654

creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you: 6.395144434705533

elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure: 10.032530332953222

to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever: 7.646324128074937

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses: 4.604086982855933

my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room: 7.386050982897693

who instantly taking the alarm set off from b: 6.481272939137539

and _that_ made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter: 10.129175627504093

bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty: 11.659033400225285

bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr: 8.017940445198152

well well said he do not make yourself unhappy: 11.293266612719087

without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment: 11.56320553923893

but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all: 11.675216830859819

cried elizabeth: 7.745509290093582

in ran mrs: 8.326769846646966

importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly: 5.8272625612590305

chapter iv: 6.801265390849918

but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again: 11.509900449762462

bingley s first choice: 8.40261685949084

_you_ may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer: 7.0412494329004875

darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together: 9.27830298765539

and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shall not come and part us i am determined: 11.12420611915963

my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not: 9.150023677261219

our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day: 8.410206473315855

his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs: 9.830758302702051

but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties: 6.989150247014092

i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them: 8.242237975637945

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr: 7.396444096190542

yes i have had a letter from him by express: 13.027848697118447

my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing: 11.407403473653082

fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness: 7.879088650882046

these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay: 8.731973119304453

bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy: 8.32539095834909

instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr: 8.48495536749568

allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer: 10.128208080580585

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr: 8.388117361253292

she shall hear my opinion: 9.386393809166902

i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient: 10.342246972781169

you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much: 10.320492141003275

denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed: 8.085883099417233

i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully: 7.2704684958642405

on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr: 10.724020327706421

the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value: 7.422403072385797

my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do: 9.721005985110708

she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers: 5.957329260105704

his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr: 10.073410281525724

louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again: 11.91696739138003

darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister: 7.236403621302811

wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony: 8.100161101608103

said elizabeth: 10.878556367058426

but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow: 10.375284833358407

collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit: 6.925410882471446

yes but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing: 5.175952008398005

darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident: 7.893761089913178

bingley never stirs without him: 6.2533273124192945

bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend: 7.543309187301059

collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london: 9.09935788337043

bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr: 7.930451735713929

it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world: 8.774938142840842

chapter xviii: 6.801265390849918

there can be no love in all this: 10.518964972888293

bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr: 8.715029748104481

chapter xx: 8.950968636090755

he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom: 5.789451457471978

kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do: 8.760366580475068

bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing: 6.681198434694687

and his sisters are charming women: 8.981443235666612

bennet was really in a most pitiable state: 12.744189249688036

you mentioned _two_ instances: 7.234506805100882

how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves: 9.028802933020337

i will not be interrupted: 10.925112562487529

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities: 9.261650374626292

she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown: 9.788638958925565

pray go to see them with sir william and maria: 12.76927759032492

he now wished it more than ever: 10.641857570931329

hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet: 8.407774054667078

lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion: 8.18288886471217

wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball: 10.789633709469419

come be quick be quick: 8.030287075422995

by you i was properly humbled: 13.976980322754484

he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away: 8.904811231670164

she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham: 10.461947039449571

elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr: 8.748476931105046

bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly: 12.077703342603435

you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr: 10.503318047097038

she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs: 11.076815969846654

elizabeth you are not serious now: 10.567527045594886

he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months: 13.095363138752566

she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make _her_ feel the obliged: 10.391369812546325

i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done: 10.59188924797138

my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you: 8.259862530530535

pardon me: 11.695936840561847

i _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me: 5.170791598038339

she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property: 6.525395175926192

it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case: 12.92701043020146

elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness: 9.17086779011849

you are safe from me: 8.601003257933922

it adds even another motive: 6.282457396101386

i came to you without a doubt of my reception: 14.862804510286812

good gracious: 8.163605883269796

bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject: 8.28028295722072

take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment: 6.260188124308169

this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem: 10.061402895810486

but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters: 12.468278764959193

bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for: 12.52197445979006

how could i ever think her like her nephew: 8.926449477086859

darcy seemed much pleased with the attention: 10.796766746431125

my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done: 11.549517312220948

darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was: 10.443857757286592

s: 16.836706329303418

you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you: 12.739050653601808

his plan did not vary on seeing them: 8.952144298208797

lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr: 6.593409150662962

are they indeed: 10.735245426319313

risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence: 8.893815271041099

darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr: 10.7183893191806

perhaps he must if he sees enough of her: 13.20869743531595

e: 6.293800138039335

i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before: 7.644546779928742

then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you: 13.249735640816413

bingley s being imposed on than that mr: 6.908217556483564

oh no: 9.121366656641708

and quite alone: 9.002246894434744

i shall never forget her appearance this morning: 6.296608491816797

for heaven s sake madam speak lower: 6.597887774979491

wickham himself: 11.196845642519998

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tm s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come: 4.898375492822

to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr: 9.825812060025473

only think what a miserable summer else we shall have: 8.493086664113461

whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable: 4.281183740219576

the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states: 6.1039045923754305

said he with a look of doubt: 12.135646251745326

it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter: 8.354657193326906

on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower: 8.795960532499947

they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought: 9.317037012006368

collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power: 10.095371405660963

what think you of _this_ sentence my dear lizzy: 7.502879315320545

darcy might leave the country but that _he_ should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week: 7.449524780012204

bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away: 7.263050345633285

i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if _i_ should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia: 6.63313557001037

he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner: 8.512338767037981

he had to be sure done much: 11.14631712933476

every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr: 9.895765421158721

did you go by the village of kympton: 9.325762479653894

it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley: 11.674635141685068

this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them: 8.138576809767464

poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance: 13.259187366732316

her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds: 8.915975639664442

bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last: 13.06267210625019

if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight: 7.935355415845802

collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels: 7.74521767962473

i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever: 12.369031710214479

none at all: 11.681432718210035

but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away: 7.652543865223341

darcy you cannot deny the fact: 8.656073084006609

he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her: 11.902477675869498

bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir: 6.92295993634224

what has she to do with it: 14.957200991739816

but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham: 7.064747263531974

having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity: 8.776343725154685

wickham with money: 9.087875459497566

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr: 9.012083723174332

it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it: 9.229254937931675

lydia declared herself satisfied: 9.024812576118535

a small sum could not do all this: 11.703247365668318

proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself: 11.22480812249258

vol: 13.110144761836318

much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr: 9.880280420955007

all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes: 12.026359873579969

darcy by character perfectly well: 6.917800429328607

where is your sash my dear: 9.579474136087631

such as vanity and pride: 10.388291392166066

this account then is what he has received from mr: 9.195269032247232

her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines: 7.188096207565955

it was all conjecture: 8.846445652267855

darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr: 9.871961085811842

bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy: 9.429963748097796

pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe: 8.437407911535047

elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits: 12.906938662439792

perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones: 5.170221433884436

in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either: 9.459450362789088

came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through: 7.607381335575248

he was to come there with wickham you know: 11.562751042676382

bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year: 8.706715564027082

her colour changed and she said no more: 11.321113638985171

no said darcy i have made no such pretension: 15.581787616328704

there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london: 7.327333566195747

no why should he: 9.991157443766342

ten thousand a year: 7.870978797767975

and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had: 11.52917788334477

what felicity: 12.350383901935379

general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg tm electronic works <NUM>: 6.366807936641904

in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour: 8.192688610595015

my feelings in every respect forbid it: 9.27351450132341

i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford: 7.540210116659729

i leave it to yourself to determine said mr: 9.87980514656009

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts: 9.035036847764673

i know you will contrive it all: 8.925567838581173

she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out: 9.567769346372698

darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he: 11.800412507106637

there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning: 13.670810715438638

miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself: 7.4274056499039665

the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy: 11.366900925876763

i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter: 10.17105869103911

my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you: 8.948776973216514

why did she come: 11.668700322276818

or in other words you are determined to have him: 11.481401903599453

and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses: 10.855339521975836

you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr: 6.6901966102017605

a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it: 6.240445919956775

had his character been known this could not have happened: 9.333131157105562

every time they met it was more decided and remarkable: 9.793051552691137

yes in conjunction with his friend: 6.85794452045569

i should imagine not: 8.349435904068795

she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man: 8.762654656984683

the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome: 8.030710241918973

philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr: 8.763820417894589

we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia: 9.111079648118888

i have sent for you on an affair of importance: 8.280353523988355

is he married or single: 8.84425832483834

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt: 17.11268114631736

at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward: 11.345909106689831

tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s: 11.247319680752218

darcy walk into the room: 8.692547562192997

elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them: 8.880329852906478

i have not been used to submit to any person s whims: 7.870102383623859

to mr: 7.827146306117142

collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day: 8.209185367104432

gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little: 9.925726286160042

they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve: 11.304335906705772

said he hastily as he opened the door: 10.288592207545955

jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr: 8.505531248313202

my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cannot write so i will dictate and you write for me: 11.200924623045513

stop me whilst you can: 8.947993543498836

she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty: 7.777819479942112

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters: 10.526758404808405

they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come mr: 10.164865618477664

when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty: 9.355580929749895

at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house: 12.59323720845315

no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_: 4.401339490953491

bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere: 8.612393408406868

she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference: 9.106122044874056

i certainly shall not: 12.285642479321634

to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own: 8.098940903872236

have you had any flirting: 15.709339807677214

i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at: 11.030287072494351

bennet was not so well pleased with it: 12.472686917204198

these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing: 5.207414784563137

miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other: 8.80773603813689

had colonel forster seen denny himself: 8.115893342377415

i shall see her in january: 10.64752341946535

the effect was immediate: 10.209832530629315

thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart: 6.8439899696044

forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia said she though i am _not_ her particular friend: 9.853152121874736

but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event: 8.441707053784654

bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr: 9.876623582122184

bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial: 10.05927170642945

chapter vi: 7.526837439137147

bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs: 13.14135301355929

i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression: 8.32468383216026

yes i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care: 6.747809909376142

yes there was something in _that_ i told you so from the first you may remember: 12.540266443405606

darcy could not have: 13.29886247844014

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from _that_ though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better: 9.783645765501795

no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called: 9.503811460067835

jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way: 13.806892343857601

what did you say of me that i did not deserve: 14.987020901862678

gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning: 9.232045843951358

but what said she after a pause can have been his motive: 10.836075051809793

that reply will do for the present: 12.513133381573896

my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party: 12.094237555288384

he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do: 9.5852986719493

in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great: 9.171216184066582

but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr: 5.150228615582369

a clergyman like you must marry: 11.299090746314569

but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character: 9.576125658629298

that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating: 10.950082816829225

i am perfectly serious in my refusal: 9.665486852496421

yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity: 11.961140106732705

but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them: 12.01812136927852

one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual: 12.139453865246121

she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance: 7.805204991936399

elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative: 10.548803034520011

my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this: 10.381155694421894

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme: 9.706725394584232

he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us: 10.813119015165725

lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these: 7.93971155036008

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry: 11.944256054854556

so much ease with such perfect good breeding: 10.0331789115959

_i_ did for you: 9.862812726561524

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr: 9.651299615237365

yet he is _such_ a man: 13.129704337781673

that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him: 7.2070720462945825

well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they: 8.303888690303994

but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters: 8.408113869085069

why any fear of detection: 7.925269216460837

in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise: 6.115137659965895

bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy: 8.36334351155465

no no nonsense lizzy: 7.54452752144301

_i_ who knew what he was: 12.008283376671418

but i dare not hope it: 9.584139146888473

why should _he_ have it more than anybody else: 8.607831531727658

elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased: 11.148561850989532

and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men: 7.723095696631112

i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_: 6.1018146881012045

but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies: 7.0701603056862465

i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do: 8.895242373349706

his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and _that_ if he marry _prudently_ his wife may teach him: 6.756999362681137

my style of writing is very different from yours: 8.64878960869256

bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast: 9.510510039783965

younge was of course removed from her charge: 10.837544103116093

in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account: 10.849466506254984

bennet still up: 9.10600355089264

darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself: 9.01974688552766

lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty: 6.761495313511364

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light: 6.415440704299653

it now first struck her that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors: 6.969266837580083

the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works: 5.030875340763013

but he is an ugly fellow: 9.799538089128479

annesley is with her: 10.005452737336231

she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible: 10.821485215623502

your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications: 7.056267986562102

as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement: 10.066147678264361

bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr: 10.725952737602311

let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them: 8.989223191486344

you must and shall be married by a special licence: 10.17861583669414

_you_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly: 8.51024348206275

there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him: 7.3343516478928175

bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you: 8.401962530090573

gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him: 8.733745478283371

can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand: 12.990703804950684

her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament: 7.0610707026882755

darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london: 13.514673493252381

my dear dear jane i am so happy: 9.870070901712504

miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt: 8.021530882258809

not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr: 9.059913752884107

a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence: 7.619013345665487

a clear ten thousand per annum: 6.608167290652139

he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed: 14.777058443987048

darcy was condemned as the worst of men: 8.0730729859343

elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them: 8.750753499253408

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door: 9.850589812742399

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate: 11.293967512809727

they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent: 6.590218841725902

elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband: 14.137987239758337

bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice: 7.671290603593303

if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough: 11.469756861147031

i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment: 8.07073747612456

chapter xix: 6.801265390849918

when tea was over mr: 8.21129216254786

bennet was quite in the fidgets: 13.555622285509344

to morrow fortnight: 13.426074336377646

his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn: 8.940060334260338

the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune: 9.828132302964452

the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr: 9.498978043546954

reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room: 10.538153674055279

pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance: 9.627966689769007

did she call to refuse her consent: 8.673213291505867

when you have killed all your own birds mr: 9.192407795073729

i _must_ have employment and society: 5.7325114011579625

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share: 8.510446928982912

imprudent as a marriage between mr: 11.590210190255032

my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers: 14.98668652668804

i desire you will do no such thing: 9.715431133887659

bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman: 10.564814078348114

collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr: 8.688883436444675

their reception at home was most kind: 11.334177806058717

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again: 10.336277527372525

jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them: 9.744034303080877

yes almost every day: 8.230924505544769

i never saw any one so shocked: 8.860490544016967

you are not going to be _missish_ i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report: 9.216868715217496

bingley cried his wife: 9.223111331122714

how could i be so silly as to wish it: 12.825733908972664

yes the late mr: 5.567285826324685

the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair: 8.055782055241194

not as you represent it: 10.545528255564047

cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction: 12.291565303953108

thought elizabeth: 16.98624078667848

by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary: 9.337779086229224

after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration: 8.181019741328502

what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are: 11.90295667032315

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was: 4.783668765390776

i am afraid you do not like your pen: 8.334467781192654

it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was: 9.9611419859371

i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude: 7.312538298934736

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word: 10.667857443382822

had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs: 10.069333745865704

to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs: 8.371639434501555

darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives: 8.500256641600926

whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes: 10.027005766188674

she was gone directly: 10.111956089873471

he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr: 7.429223262939781

that is the place to get husbands: 13.346685060144322

why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me: 11.222453742109568

the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited: 10.024278289706103

bingley: 7.073460734909499

i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her: 8.549224905813535

gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both: 9.587390599858022

how strange this is: 10.694478239664056

i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech: 9.386790910930738

collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted: 7.321129551364419

as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done: 12.464978765436356

whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr: 11.479813321319003

there is nothing he would not do for her: 12.452339751715709

elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more: 7.051683343090752

his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london: 7.354117456982368

perhaps it would have been better replied her sister: 11.743666238479086

nor did that day wear out her resentment: 7.214787640053025

what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr: 9.398258410576313

i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation: 8.869238177309724

not at all: 9.042498726168242

no indeed i did not: 11.903982925437743

bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on: 10.631524562091217

it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she: 10.642626245815412

bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful: 10.032135477318887

this is not quite enough to make her understand his character: 10.557078844897418

hurst nothing at all: 8.261588049886024

chapter iii: 7.526660462159987

elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course: 8.640456769773161

who could have done less for her: 12.528969724562192

but however insincere _you_ may choose to be you shall not find _me_ so: 8.256592386942463

there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table: 7.551549402612736

then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs: 9.779149838616581

after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer: 8.272993304017307

but i was embarrassed: 11.134717733566783

much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married: 10.224428561807573

_that_ is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter: 5.817344484216962

gardiner who was several years younger than mrs: 6.8911693944352965

they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs: 10.381007074801335

kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on: 7.950341216828381

they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them: 8.509048525662612

wickham and rejoiced in it: 8.543132865237842

wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland: 10.657485207819432

i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married: 6.745815679598861

what do you mean: 9.434826800476063

she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise: 6.321678012474617

he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it: 11.875168321834163

i hope added mrs: 7.247776314917243

sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance: 10.33952217731821

i am so pleased so happy: 6.382995220854324

i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her: 10.96042062585316

i have nothing to say against _him_ he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better: 12.198603265010506

a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy: 8.913111867864542

but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation: 4.704580039753415

if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy: 10.924452742802258

long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself: 10.156593906479097

cried elizabeth when she had finished it: 10.49867978428407

a great deal of good management depend upon it: 7.309574536239112

not that i mean to find fault with _you_ for such things i know are all chance in this world: 10.57762930728369

this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage: 5.56705287819739

but of this answer lydia heard not a word: 8.515502780842931

were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr: 10.373982716656569

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible: 10.331302365857729

collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr: 8.54131635793838

and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen: 11.367959427238937

they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family: 8.710702881394234

no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr: 7.848862039751983

the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with: 6.304057995729695

collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction: 10.19135714813609

occupied in observing mr: 7.2355631900553306

bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life: 9.287029635924473

bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased: 9.66534818217761

this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr: 11.618005102229487

while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible: 9.290423315312141

we had better go into the avenue: 10.55920958482207

for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts: 9.166354690082667

it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her: 8.726186657163636

sir william how can you tell such a story: 12.084376188981992

did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring: 9.109371704221763

for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path: 8.943436708163341

wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is: 8.72937362595456

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject: 7.734598694102004

upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself: 7.246866414346416

she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste: 7.707885433829745

you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper: 7.724400707604276

chapter vii: 6.801265390849918

it was over at last however: 11.703532800605373

at four of the clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said mr: 6.445322994450534

collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr: 8.188488052565178

do not repeat what i then said: 11.170545863067641

he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before: 9.645565093326882

it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your s_ seems to have been: 7.083034937954498

bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr: 7.929278737660532

elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself: 10.921464103342663

in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness: 7.30112945511324

by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent: 8.806788882257718

and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven of the clock: 9.390132400898306

my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents: 7.632464509512651

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening: 10.008015132175473

i never heard of such a thing: 10.451725118689277

my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other: 8.506555500836715

as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch: 7.045520850993024

_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest: 10.324735579324408

first of all he asked miss lucas: 14.71058901648339

if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes: 7.228272360260422

gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on: 6.594611348956083

do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent: 9.423779177219021

bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer: 9.991098380840922

pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam: 8.78642139928825

he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him: 9.6527450442928

those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable: 6.741346124555688

and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless: 9.445335318939362

but so we all do: 9.364079818518535

i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here: 12.474698320115742

her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us: 6.005034462365846

darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents: 12.35292040965981

he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen: 9.047147517899985

you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness: 6.279537582115164

i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire: 7.729802835863346

chapter viii: 6.801265390849918

when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted: 10.16704334510514

as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination: 7.738555802117289

and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn: 12.60568509104827

the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent: 7.580167059862259

they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound: 7.662372045179029

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word: 10.008131383828879

well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them: 9.1243477375191

is my father in town: 14.561247092358645

i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection: 8.057797855285648

she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet: 13.052336584494551

let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers: 6.031942387589985

it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor: 5.905610528350674

to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her: 10.322885798561746

very odd: 11.3428581509195

hurst were going out: 7.87679613820821

we have heard only once: 10.513146725491449

the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility: 7.325025855931426

yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had: 10.125198124543491

can i have the carriage: 17.434733006096586

to mrs: 10.021185844374516

he arranges the business just as he pleases: 8.957262599119824

collins on his return highly gratified mrs: 8.283095331030411

and they are really to be married: 17.15963968671419

elizabeth longed to observe that mr: 6.869949978340478

this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west: 8.776444460582148

i will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again: 6.2765957380670825

my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again: 7.974919432983526

i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him: 5.609082672199046

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was: 8.135786423126087

you need not distress yourself: 8.10550088351912

collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish: 7.497079330881506

consider how important every moment is in such a case: 10.791227190820903

kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr: 7.4724243585202945

collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs: 8.552439982562905

on this subject what can you have to say: 12.084399736683915

bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother: 11.560277374183041

collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party: 9.36394651239777

darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her: 8.490727020587679

till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness: 10.5114763261567

gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham: 11.948255771635324

if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs <NUM>: 5.525563053103

not perhaps of neglecting his own interest: 8.937435704743953

his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham: 9.049186211465283

what did colonel forster say: 10.032800619120302

a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their _three_ months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_: 9.463986668656354

it is very hard to think that she might have been mr: 10.484454827769387

but if i were you i would stand by the nephew: 11.797719399217508

i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up: 8.406831455865586

bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever: 8.220282292412502

elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply: 12.222618232640487

i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr: 10.738778304167862

but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then: 11.949553987764789

it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go: 7.487803146735814

my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church: 15.53522502603978

the tête à tête surprised them: 5.937395480149756

collins: 7.2319673813189045

it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them: 8.553721845661375

in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence: 9.171180972209468

you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form: 4.134650742830907

the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood: 8.761886296604688

in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach: 8.554329598158054

philips s: 10.548397950539687

wickham s intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army: 8.269851313248536

you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world: 12.65455068667832

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr: 6.277496366443783

how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter: 15.52816292631307

but slyness seems the fashion: 5.927371943088056

my father however is partial to mr: 6.957175157881479

though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced: 8.340415274111814

she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal: 8.371625175447761

nearly three weeks: 9.66214565718072

darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued: 7.502272441991185

_that_ you certainly shall: 11.246966586310148

as a child i was taught what was _right_ but i was not taught to correct my temper: 9.078507161279752

he has children of his own and may have more: 11.988879297214224

but is it certain absolutely certain: 9.001166488566573

well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day: 14.225977413833606

it cannot be concealed from any one: 9.485316692980078

and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs: 9.53460957045105

she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks: 10.522305114607299

but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture: 6.126083940896896

how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls: 13.438703281030849

bennet s manor: 7.578879381935642

but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly: 9.303128247555541

hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort: 10.189740028349206

i am the happiest creature in the world: 6.735917714848727

there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king: 8.905612043234736

gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off: 9.50435150795696

bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton: 8.017707265114115

and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them: 7.8666176291011665

darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand: 12.915503144934513

it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on: 9.632607069735869

gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south: 8.643748823475047

nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states: 11.458922783059215

if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him: 11.692719586318027

bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage: 8.188466801450152

things are settled so oddly: 7.051886936057926

never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f: 11.369580297410462

his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them: 10.997692890194038

gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction: 9.238248164120808

when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish: 10.566565422634465

miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice: 6.4711318345569

if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs: 8.553966341183576

i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement: 10.498738859653235

jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline: 8.532332340502718

it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it: 12.676147401115879

his doing so drew her notice: 6.4072293805536225

bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend: 9.108749615384983

what is mr: 9.446012475271521

i do not trust my own partiality: 9.736482943733106

exceedingly well: 12.70934723539467

after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match: 9.508184628335774

bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr: 8.757404801535552

he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her: 9.552347572148147

i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me: 7.638966823091435

steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her: 8.984470345110045

hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments: 7.924679682134856

forster the delight of mrs: 6.556206563243504

from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him: 12.472374154113027

she is almost three and twenty: 7.185181387265888

i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs: 8.243092970732745

it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do: 10.70786073905238

but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied: 13.162241431536108

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman madam: 12.212779453514566

but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr: 7.9607868087590195

i quite detest the man: 6.8253152207906505

do not distress me by the idea: 13.28012819272649

no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind: 7.032874050942018

if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment: 9.511795456981746

nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy: 8.445505630425876

for god s sake say no more of his partners: 11.185408519444323

collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure: 9.291664660654742

not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr: 8.489044464551583

yes there can for mine is totally different: 6.065047356492551

it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing: 10.007218589457203

after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read: 8.745250001033604

he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr: 8.97281864659749

four nieces of mrs: 7.696975494894023

at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him: 8.299446773975829

howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs: 11.66315579441569

they were all astonished and mr: 7.4616630788624665

do you play and sing miss bennet: 7.717947653816573

he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune: 8.913197955789963

she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body: 10.380094385891237

she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held: 11.383839541904209

never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her: 9.785718716046988

how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day: 9.616431832407946

but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure: 7.810922607139855

elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible: 10.336639785436429

i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done: 7.205587552599291

we _will_ know where we have gone we _will_ recollect what we have seen: 9.062651402919208

that it ought not to be attempted: 16.503815950920647

this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given: 7.41702197950229

collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him: 9.08403014220581

elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr: 5.346693380440533

if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh: 10.97638275123957

it is useless to talk of it: 8.91304564707231

bennet alarmed: 10.91401234674938

has she any family: 9.583893836455692

darcy may be guessed: 11.51451374493939

he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases: 10.139947339359141

if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation: 7.179282597927163

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year: 12.407302120246344

she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend: 12.113433160059126

section <NUM>: 9.731336663123622

my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking: 10.64589113682961

miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr: 11.827180238264308

well much good may it do them: 7.398987545602861

we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice: 9.351263110091072

it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever: 9.570094593849308

here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of: 11.22410016401487

my dear aunt this is being serious indeed: 7.382878778709735

vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously: 6.201075078852072

my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much: 15.432867645409633

their visits to mrs: 7.526982871705056

who do you mean my dear: 14.215995254367732

i cannot quite agree with you _there_: 8.58843329823825

there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard: 11.448412960885186

but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt: 9.12376898811096

to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed: 11.490592400145353

in three volumes: 7.072948006974494

the strangeness of mr: 6.250412305586158

the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her: 8.069863885779153

what a charming amusement for young people this is mr: 7.702942763541699

pride and prejudice a novel: 6.205995638602769

e below: 10.157804099927155

indeed i could not: 13.076662449143043

if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable: 7.8546203009281585

had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it: 10.509567619500276

is not this an agreeable surprise: 10.49146198609113

when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist: 8.476695672353054

after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr: 7.447603159707388

i have no right to give _my_ opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise: 9.15199386990696

when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible: 7.524277668961236

she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr: 4.506675586210244

i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town: 8.922050209281474

ten thousand a year and very likely more: 8.21096930115928

not these two or three years perhaps: 8.479049877008551

but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs: 10.765625322710559

till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr: 8.882313025846353

i suspected as much replied elizabeth: 10.809580031147714

she is a most charming young lady indeed: 10.055132006724245

with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart: 9.565686302232477

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter: 9.730349929966337

wont it kitty: 8.327434973349883

the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity: 7.418648577943645

hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her: 8.84444254037359

what a good joke it will be: 10.558939827730688

as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was: 11.26104637469166

consider mr: 10.699655378856388

the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is <NUM> <NUM>: 4.08203435230033

with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee: 7.918528643477777

it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are: 11.322637480751524

after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice: 5.416949947014055

she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still: 8.905503311632762

well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now: 13.203301451999662

he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room: 7.765991535611528

he must be an oddity i think said she: 10.67761543301631

her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself: 11.765246176491619

elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr: 9.960814189860045

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information: 9.671457296210477

he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london: 13.03475703583907

bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out: 9.076780718037647

but _now_ we may be silent: 10.532115172594386

and above all things keep mr: 7.849080506573716

collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence: 9.17058939165977

tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure: 13.252865292191201

bennet instantly answered oh dear: 6.4620623616518715

the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr: 9.80184890718802

i owe all that i know of it to another not to you: 17.471212759356103

indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not: 10.26612926674114

darcy that they scarcely ever saw him: 11.57244698347184

she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house: 8.384733866033622

she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr: 9.90980834525252

i hate such false friends: 6.608706796359556

she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class: 9.991954120337795

your first position is false: 6.1289560721829

elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal: 9.881919673760414

darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found: 11.782531477603458

but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city: 9.732148165634579

of what are you talking: 14.331312133857214

bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem: 9.718967218103504

it is impossible: 8.862591889656935

darcy did not wish for cards and mr: 9.991050057573604

it was a fortnight since mrs: 8.32161502176898

and have you answered the letter: 11.44813527440122

i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own: 10.699288500788922

collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably: 8.571928910921697

but self though it would intrude could not engross her: 10.558057619833935

family pride and _filial_ pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this: 11.159033901908348

so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great: 10.097509050384565

gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces: 11.102171258209184

collins you must send a servant with them: 8.74609115698681

they have at least that advantage: 10.351826056605546

true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room: 9.959979796834787

he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over: 9.647525013392528

she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr: 11.562562416169877

she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who _did_ call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give: 8.956129079474865

i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings: 9.958100984736902

but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done: 15.344759216594724

a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year: 6.672407792477382

_your_ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance: 8.927758308679245

is she handsome: 11.355964134575036

we do not suffer by _accident_: 8.596750896197124

when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses: 11.92422315309734

my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point: 8.95974228891197

she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more: 11.358346624139958

lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home: 11.94117217230441

she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers: 7.8499676818280495

to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh: 8.719271294390094

at five of the clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner: 7.881955513087336

she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome: 8.749776146319677

oh well: 10.517045604512944

in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness: 10.464400370322974

the second began: 12.3891804972546

how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton: 12.035114427807049

collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove: 8.184483754774206

the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object: 7.718330986744264

if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards: 9.237283886687424

then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman: 10.869931202832309

had it been your uncle s doing i must and _would_ have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way: 7.885291897131744

miss darcy the daughter of mr: 8.08012693124062

_i_ shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you: 10.681486645819003

sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs: 6.19327907852812

she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns: 7.503650867197795

that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger: 9.407744475103616

of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work: 7.119556298351378

bennet s expectations were fully answered: 5.63906261198815

i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do: 7.96952579654395

but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity: 10.361441351166013

i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear: 9.289170028344154

i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage: 9.651349373900146

c: 11.228974465208008

they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same: 12.53665035279941

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house: 6.575645993472162

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend: 11.115012866101399

collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr: 10.053833633523356

you may depend on it replied the other for mrs: 8.099683824157527

i am only ashamed of his asking so little: 10.67084700324675

her father lifted up his eyes: 9.195577890902763

bennet replied that he had not: 11.610776584600874

but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon: 12.500490921078272

if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them: 12.486302057382435

each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr: 13.041965842490008

long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously: 9.036794154254686

and of this place thought she i might have been mistress: 15.952783968601187

on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away: 10.309363077544822

but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt: 14.95464766268387

i am sure i shall break _mine_ said lydia: 6.044166113588084

i am not at all afraid of her dying: 12.066680053301242

bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of: 7.120416141706478

they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit: 5.4768712606590535

when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same: 16.4772311011265

when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr: 8.219420244405983

i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love: 3.999662238727921

collins as the wisest thing she ever did: 8.627001249263136

long has promised to introduce him: 9.100777419157952

you are all to come to pemberley at christmas: 10.101267863163237

darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister: 14.100234526372565

if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you: 11.855416923843395

they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself: 11.616406921999253

i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little _endeavour_ at civility i am thus rejected: 8.437102709724202

but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him: 11.082015223930771

i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject: 10.188623731968512

we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home: 8.210499836473739

i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women: 5.829070534094796

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr: 9.283750795624343

she finds miss pope a treasure: 4.714664884729394

as for jane _her_ anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to: 8.615675669733342

i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future: 11.228194663432609

we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine: 8.71031906841894

haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off: 6.134660819671419

she had obtained private intelligence that mr: 5.592580233983007

he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant: 11.885553039233505

darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach: 7.946532815678416

it is no such thing: 9.724507005184227

no never: 12.75602311646335

collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise: 8.355634830289047

his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips: 6.977850924723552

collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long: 10.27863043154745

do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenberg tm works unless you comply with paragraph <NUM>: 4.855891390193187

she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you: 11.214764420919598

the possibility of mr: 7.449322034832974

bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit: 11.246748604134208

yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over: 8.724376386494773

the dejection was almost universal: 8.061100471373322

she is grown so brown and coarse: 5.093033825936809

wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison: 8.151869399801733

her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself: 8.030093871190216

darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me: 11.468278139931302

sir william had been delighted with him: 12.053588919367384

your s c: 6.8973535855783945

said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam: 8.89929893026273

she is a very good kind of girl i believe: 10.026638284503633

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right: 11.741933625595045

bennet by talking in this way: 8.023837579714984

collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her: 9.932259634266329

but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour: 8.372840924069749

and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over: 10.735296102694408

i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr: 9.371390305257737

information about the mission of project gutenberg tm project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers: 5.217152658111723

she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked: 11.053047304500002

i often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_: 8.950195243472091

my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour: 8.561200305726945

i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point: 8.288704049829912

it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity: 5.439584258034954

breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday: 8.173518003462544

she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial: 12.394924313118302

jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears: 7.085095423935198

but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill: 14.280060509457405

bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him: 9.643860468931642

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance: 7.063179909735176

we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs: 6.7037869581701095

he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem: 11.171123556709942

lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all: 7.101067471442122

hurst was observing their game: 5.939185406559466

but you know married women have never much time for writing: 8.4509162899251

yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover: 7.934715281758803

her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious: 7.672841252065202

five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs: 10.046893129115658

all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over: 11.47441019843232

the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_: 9.598130138008067

and to see dear wickham too: 12.654774347919316

bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again: 10.076441869931326

the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr: 9.761685687565896

on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance: 7.400556108214558

she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible: 8.592415382678988

it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr: 10.323252509795829

darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure: 8.021404678121554

he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce: 8.84361818171262

collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way: 7.66774027632253

elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr: 9.706389787966755

at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable: 11.488742597885734

lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia: 11.525476419716943

_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam: 10.590049757659326

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply: 7.72725373863741

miss lucas is married and settled: 9.078395111153199

collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time: 8.272821479540996

under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief: 9.949021952934594

why does she not come in: 11.332826057253506

but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done: 11.915562484737256

he has also _brotherly_ pride which with _some_ brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers: 7.027830485477266

no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night: 9.015211723211044

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family: 12.263655428858394

but still he would be her husband: 13.818141857886777

darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat: 11.034904281579134

yes madam said mrs: 7.101099330066402

can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good: 7.2473673189066

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected: 10.899626238902016

but they did pass away and mr: 9.16014353568618

darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned: 8.08000647313104

elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off: 11.240322615006907

jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman: 10.34371822390145

chapter v: 6.801265390849918

elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal: 7.186877229642979

so much the better: 10.503174378574249

when mr: 6.6119826349264965

they came: 12.226599080307986

if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence: 7.112059950449048

that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs: 9.504517038682948

as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room: 7.978796643583323

however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves: 9.82711810296545

bingley since you went away said mrs: 7.27451601533465

exclaimed elizabeth you are too good: 11.858047397541517

his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion: 8.916566354523361

i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her: 9.2097441829989

there is nothing else to be done: 10.916227770029854

a thousand things may arise in six months: 6.84868130616385

she cried this is delightful indeed: 10.453280124558104

when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer: 10.92440858846791

darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s: 10.51179464263352

he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north: 8.403430139745785

if: 12.231907323162176

catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing: 6.164995852206632

again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification: 7.88164006306855

my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these: 10.886776403014627

her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness: 8.125321560637834

bingley and talked of mrs: 9.200215287642525

i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read: 8.522372569538348

to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love: 8.34968102083775

elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr: 8.764384767606481

she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance: 9.965816859974694

chapter ix: 6.801265390849918

bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph: 6.506980932482564

i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older: 13.079565970837821

lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty: 8.142272008297287

no no: 12.38778346926308

amongst the most violent against him was mrs: 11.023169127338022

in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective: 7.986231601466397

i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish: 8.418346748097788

i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters: 10.691477438256598

well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr: 9.290872031280342

it was the favourite wish of _his_ mother as well as of her s: 11.162551824058863

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well: 7.744892266086571

he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected: 11.14047403451987

no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton: 13.704728065674956

but _your_ arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family: 9.188326783821582

repeated mr: 10.313120749784154

darcy looked therefore she could not tell: 11.697577074705361

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton: 9.883267307224983

such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon: 8.73493433813896

she dared not even mention that gentleman: 8.150992871866748

when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane: 11.707656565295634

at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here: 10.376985314923072

said mr: 8.868455475837786

yes he introduced us to his sister: 9.017652593699284

darcy improves on acquaintance: 7.2680183034811545

when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away: 11.290657817015394

the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and mrs: 10.31277840143635

between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard: 9.067992256619677

this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors: 9.954125398946463

i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen: 9.360946316756655

the other is miss de bourgh: 9.420375956230803

general information about project gutenberg tm electronic works: 5.881363150734723

if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all: 7.833060144541048

no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: 9.162555707483383

this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for: 14.700342793188524

you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful: 5.8840126513673425

darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley: 6.946470007548951

and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north: 13.033499542076406

she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley: 10.670696198008814

in as short a time as mr: 9.119200078177784

the moment of her release from him was ecstacy: 13.150551637381001

have you heard from my uncle: 11.423110699851895

an easy distance do you call it: 10.067227329181119

she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave: 7.825567174183096

elizabeth looked archly and turned away: 6.282948508078653

darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr: 9.139146711831549

wickham is safe: 8.478419807585954

collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too: 9.769580010893256

collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_: 12.218792525057612

miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards: 8.395161854035793

believe her to be deceived by all means: 12.76029802455493

well and what news does it bring: 11.703638873789902

not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body: 9.459676528736054

but let me advise you to think better of it: 11.198315088714542

while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing: 6.426201381052702

wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters: 8.464100169161982

she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different: 8.118835683616767

they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered: 9.645347898715483

it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed: 11.424293063076595

he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her: 5.82781098662976

it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr: 7.794061502254586

i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long: 8.149374740655405

i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it: 9.161498911204333

but however he did not: 9.324371209698915

miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs: 9.602767557654229

the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow: 10.338495043812525

his character was to speak for itself: 14.365830451432776

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it: 11.122147936609764

i hope my dear said mr: 8.404645355345524

what will become of me: 9.217218767520395

bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness: 6.718195064778185

she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room: 7.7621717687123075

darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot: 9.502513155993455

but she is nothing to me now: 16.340114635856306

and her calling here was prodigiously civil: 8.264173327341139

intending to trace their route: 8.678247549123915

astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her: 7.638271010157904

hurst soon found even his open petition rejected: 5.361491953406142

but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us: 11.733193667217265

you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address: 8.275868898884188

but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it: 10.690718639092198

imagine our surprise: 9.684409170279388

how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr: 8.167379953406433

i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection: 8.603999164763186

you alluded to something else: 7.306287301764904

no but it must be done soon: 14.051317472373443

he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable: 10.888603307972899

such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned: 8.871180233184948

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed: 7.166353505196777

she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him: 10.43064697157567

has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves: 7.277124656047938

nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related: 13.60834568245702

collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete: 8.764844560737581

but that is one great difference between us: 8.717467247476726

i will think no more about him: 10.542520044312527

as for their mother mr: 12.600742591292843

sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers: 8.256682033061681

do you draw: 11.018844966748464

elizabeth could bear it no longer: 9.365390868043587

it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else: 8.762485213492193

and when we _do_ return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing: 9.532113165999128

bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk: 7.7143814869473495

it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing: 11.625346290009029

denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire: 12.125609442244246

do let me ask my partner to introduce you: 7.280186209341049

collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day: 7.785210975241743

why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks: 9.772482182252466

but it is all all too late now: 8.354530391607256

you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us: 9.527427393610386

she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham: 10.108733274185877

it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit: 6.980118278194735

this must be the grossest falsehood: 10.48493918859122

you are joking lizzy: 7.4993856966676775

would mr: 10.896026302451777

pursuing her way along the lane she then began it: 8.279977377959119

lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use: 9.45671719319726

bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr: 7.897301498310893

lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off: 10.92836097471873

collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me: 6.511705946562771

unfeeling selfish girl: 8.680423337942758

i should take him even on _my_ slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man: 7.113607625054238

she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion: 9.210427119071236

that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion: 10.778188820557046

one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself: 8.789390111700346

what all five out at once: 6.28563890403956

i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth: 6.8886386309233965

we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire: 10.485729075957895

his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy: 7.615321231321992

i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship: 11.147742751412082

i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent: 7.471447733014792

gardiner was so little to be trusted: 16.045796552164557

it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills: 7.216766754432657

the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me: 10.695219315689203

forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away: 9.864334049870566

after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr: 11.00873524402116

bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr: 9.135684282377651

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again: 8.831555803770327

nobody wants him to come: 13.047201489518793

people do not die of little trifling colds: 8.804756914475984

that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily: 9.422132394273156

so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him: 9.246684561007818

said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am: 11.48346886932012

i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds: 7.39905113570863

on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me: 10.33147736397986

he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world: 9.018624289696682

but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered: 10.082168012920016

gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w: 7.245154765182992

dear madam cried mrs: 9.367646457710029

my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel: 8.600715807456787

and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false: 9.110974990850153

then taking the disengaged arm of mr: 5.6336101195554775

he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily: 9.996278624450284

i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object: 8.631284380456703

i know them a little: 13.627676670895328

but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea: 7.248099881657151

i can much more easily believe mr: 8.830124821896419

how should you have liked making sermons: 9.795288062586625

darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred: 6.770445674981891

bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs: 7.1967044468020385

bingley is come: 10.214518190255767

here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell: 9.566610966801099

if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one: 9.867015861453966

if he _had another_ motive i am sure it would never disgrace him: 7.594644748255361

i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least: 6.550880835125456

i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister: 7.290467656164286

bingley if she could: 14.8524875010642

in a short time i shall have a daughter married: 14.576213580925735

such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st: 10.301271848592036

women fancy admiration means more than it does: 10.199589978179548

smiles decked the face of mrs: 6.0758370392542975

i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy: 10.046035208588735

elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh: 8.342322151390587

this information however startled mrs: 6.263645449108377

you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people: 13.367363001372501

his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes: 10.598059130933335

against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr: 5.982766861683057

collins who was complimenting mr: 7.511375210713061

her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted: 14.824672917196517

after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me: 7.0930388178661055

every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections: 10.887833962893604

yes but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it: 8.320008491195082

darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable: 6.488830664960277

she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening: 8.403174644854802

they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt: 8.250985707936882

and a special licence: 8.854297620283056

let me do it without farther loss of time: 8.96416236043988

lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr: 8.287645498765203

many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory: 13.029639561371452

we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice: 4.988627972929782

interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other: 9.081850723172305

neglect: 20.708930979297097

i think she will be pleased with the hermitage: 12.692406995375633

very well and this offer of marriage you have refused: 12.377452390498359

bennet was quite disconcerted: 9.074680538528545

i dearly love a laugh: 7.8294173191423795

this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed: 11.176602354390015

their fortune on both sides is splendid: 5.966494444849351

they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister: 7.9847806202089275

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect: 9.985573691763872

it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried: 10.132606316897753

i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require: 10.276066059516982

all was joy and kindness: 8.74691691898967

has your governess left you: 7.55394700026988

did you see it: 12.854125826596468

you will not be fit to be seen when you get there: 11.216887717352783

tell me once for all are you engaged to him: 11.626683527274285

bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would: 11.608812462643035

i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked: 5.408358793928456

that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter: 11.939910593499139

you tear them to pieces: 10.379288671567025

to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate: 10.269923525350908

bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house: 6.700568174100055

jane s is nothing to it nothing at all: 11.733861563760772

you are uniformly charming: 7.976113328678435

with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr: 5.603734553805617

that is not very likely our authority was too good: 10.386230720097895

but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs: 8.520277954489112

true: 13.990157281675609

have you seen any pleasant men: 8.049041173987966

she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility: 8.145104960117731

it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it: 7.497145846580127

with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself: 10.627366903035009

i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now: 9.015730149075509

gardiner thought of him and mrs: 11.204655006392894

elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs: 8.3114139415665

you see how continually we are engaged there: 9.233614192168465

let us sit down: 9.988662648257161

collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted: 9.399231809540629

to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr: 6.3994896547454445

in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs: 12.130649476038124

miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former: 10.251604925796537

lizzy declares she will not have mr: 10.259386916877494

i did not think mrs: 8.907301844370407

and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them: 10.224397502213714

darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence: 7.019315872446157

sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise: 8.672030491044659

their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves: 10.724323543649984

all connection between us seemed now dissolved: 6.123264753243088

if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine: 9.838028456990408

bennet s civilities: 8.205623087454967

at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion: 8.13967270322047

but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion: 7.374220996097041

collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance: 7.6931613957902005

perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth: 9.720303756766938

she replied in the affirmative: 15.68479256136357

had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd: 8.452602432261001

and they _must_ marry: 10.304769722216317

and gravely glancing at mr: 6.177384620278622

mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached: 6.991668945962559

her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty: 7.308858275707304

darcy that mr: 6.965098188574413

i wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_: 11.766659262718695

who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly: 8.930610720003651

jane was beyond competition her favourite child: 8.128392862056508

darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings: 6.739860136915923

to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open: 8.591750757603

he is as fine a fellow said mr: 6.314206559452396

five daughters brought up at home without a governess: 9.680461689792917

he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement: 10.638825394531988

i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr: 11.739877641245494

he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday: 8.888770552993439

do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share: 11.582927162677452

that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance: 9.859755411547809

good heaven: 10.03026584406685

she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means: 7.606738238051927

you judge very properly said mr: 5.595141551008319

but i am at his disposal: 9.018050734991641

upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield: 10.48393400694091

they were hopeless of remedy: 7.605973590186304

it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage: 12.21956599405832

i cannot see why mrs: 6.539693805430239

he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield _she_ a beauty: 8.876537383514856

she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs: 8.18599768755436

elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion: 8.745966929527688

write to me very often my dear: 18.097355561246417

resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned: 10.170862099811119

every thing being settled between _them_ mr: 7.309386884768793

when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both: 8.249160237657481

lord bless me: 8.540222136031565

but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required: 7.660352650483646

but consider your daughters: 8.20643833760343

let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself: 11.510541323690525

their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them: 6.424382392137691

if there _were_ but such another man for you: 6.1182512734968295

darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr: 9.274069025610359

regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr: 8.158885448659987

perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now: 14.12179023671076

they must be a great loss to _your_ family: 10.262462417797853

wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr: 11.700374623786269

why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley: 13.460859638678865

i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me so before: 9.466367624380489

will you come and see me: 13.102553494564942

he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane: 8.105124924499142

find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her: 14.67271661822341

for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof: 6.221932401597705

the discussion of mr: 7.27688854414428

your uncle: 13.71248812006414

elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man: 8.427332050438373

said her mother: 13.66109972161862

her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity: 8.112743432096853

the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr: 8.764439360314366

lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter: 5.607674790196823

i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself: 9.332727199938041

lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome: 7.014390928262371

oh my dear lizzy: 9.6961689996367

she went on: 12.59593253442911

the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend: 8.404803798509754

bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object: 10.21001397997749

but not before they went to brighton: 12.366703906987723

when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence: 8.072700735284329

perhaps we might be deceived: 14.75707688815054

or why did he thus come a day before he was expected: 11.723991047371289

i appeal to mr: 6.335325737348145

miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed: 8.855501210280293

i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful: 10.15955531388665

i never saw a more promising inclination: 7.586226435950213

hurst: 14.135791935361302

there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know: 12.28417850231644

have not you always hated him: 11.744833341372184

but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered: 13.803323900203203

to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the <NUM> per cents: 10.624737020018218

elizabeth made no answer: 6.169939605273774

you have no compassion on my poor nerves: 9.685925376823283

indeed i have sir was her answer: 12.187076216030945

darcy took her advice and did finish his letter: 6.886281288026403

he placed himself by her: 9.043552363858918

i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time: 10.961859833397483

something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life: 13.475096062099464

i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so: 12.816233049447984

reynolds was of no trifling nature: 9.51742397044407

the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father: 7.624168957421255

i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir: 8.302087534441084

i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins: 5.6553788309019435

now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself: 13.25655085348363

i am confident that she would have performed delightfully: 9.024197429990133

cried mrs: 6.894031266022106

gardiner s behaviour laid them all under: 8.903231474618865

miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place: 9.683052124416939

we must trespass a little longer on your kindness: 8.87998830126288

said jane as she finished it: 11.663448816465218

she was teazed by mr: 6.498192306622462

true said mr: 9.325779988342545

on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer: 11.877133077962675

after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations: 10.004608978098757

i will have no reserves from _you_: 8.679827935225658

i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing: 10.695678104880695

from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry: 9.79398800574273

these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not: 8.310818781974264

i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these: 8.716423932361286

in the hall they parted: 12.294469376261297

darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton: 9.146043814098032

is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring: 11.031725143188831

most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility <URL> this web site includes information about project gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks: 5.306590378661061

you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for _your_ approbation alone: 7.434318309840948

follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can: 7.233985238290519

<NUM> through <NUM>: 7.076901797500058

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention: 9.63379299601897

collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr: 8.945449621310631

but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife: 6.40596826555324

if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs: 11.118305595479976

an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth: 7.122406423555926

you write uncommonly fast: 8.188905801417073

had i known what i ought what i dared to do: 12.227032642865446

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion: 8.145714153979661

the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd: 9.301255132051134

how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains: 8.077063384854316

she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with: 9.198418125315145

he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again: 10.593281590470303

darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him: 11.523621393540875

in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam: 7.497573457622637

for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness: 11.173764388369099

collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed: 5.790716276821818

it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions: 9.226940105275526

i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday: 10.675177704571672

i should like to know how he behaves among strangers: 7.912382544560549

i must find mr: 8.16322935328962

bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so: 11.164814137707042

yes i do comprehend a great deal in it: 9.575596097123054

charlotte the wife of mr: 6.09346754079776

her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs: 10.521464596013926

and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount: 10.089793449446878

we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him: 11.252667464702949

wickham lydia were all forgotten: 11.215894850425794

wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker: 8.327321560271578

are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy: 7.828512406537061

at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready: 7.541151882352331

i have not a doubt of your doing very well together: 10.422205813139852

bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him: 9.116464250631855

she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse: 8.776914864993401

he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing: 10.83337969430983

after this day jane said no more of her indifference: 12.247105199457302

how is such a man to be worked on: 13.116549977558405

elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected: 7.586277036902309

he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her: 11.322781855991977

darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them: 8.911532922251137

and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again: 11.016207424506634

in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr: 9.749573805248753

for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body: 9.731219663387973

my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says: 11.200698473516564

bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept: 7.2790546647760905

for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her: 9.821110131254997

i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming: 12.411125420518932

collins i think: 11.125575966383082

darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her: 6.545392028587606

she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller: 7.965900106390641

in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library: 9.73139578769062

but do not imagine it was from any silly cause: 11.362972991992724

the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention: 8.779986952202169

we neither of us perform to strangers: 7.714294035301746

bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask: 9.653793228269931

have you never happened to see her there: 11.460277550183296

her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said: 10.376654511699172

collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary: 7.444756444393199

a man who had felt less might: 10.684581636945811

chapter xvi: 6.801265390849918

bennet thus began the projected conversation: 6.825477735650749

she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself: 10.40261870455983

the express was sent off directly: 7.184675909043117

how so: 11.57267888866856

he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us: 11.360450214642901

if you _will_ thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone: 8.386326731248433

but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you: 10.32510006314477

has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage: 8.73013272583327

sure he will not leave london before he has found them: 13.584255044456267

she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter: 9.73829962997886

how are you all: 14.058286055447647

the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch: 12.303307748057827

i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas: 9.409522325571116

you give me fresh life and vigour: 8.425934008060507

it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself: 7.655578736794092

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation: 10.106193778536639

collins knew not what to make of him: 10.447022125848967

project gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks unless you receive specific permission: 8.933405027228057

but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage: 9.97707917266336

you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg tm works: 7.002076191846449

bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend: 12.046980863831156

a gamester: 10.896073778590104

why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing: 7.648590690965421

well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love: 8.108052060681466

you are lucky in having such a master: 10.212803544853104

she has known him only a fortnight: 10.977756457044451

my dear father i congratulate you: 7.2831779993674

during their walk it was resolved that mr: 11.100104188376372

colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm: 8.601053806029535

she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct: 9.345536240109693

but that is nothing to us: 12.83011139632093

she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times: 9.73982463636711

lady catherine sir william and mr: 7.650169372294758

she is so fond of mrs: 9.398680460486634

bennet very dull for several days: 6.249113201879941

she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley: 9.575187113336545

you must not disappoint your father: 8.519452848083798

hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it: 9.960039863762043

her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved: 8.44742304220771

no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph: 8.76400589576619

what shall we do with him: 13.175584924828177

i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper: 8.682511621136388

to be only just _tolerable_: 10.650530028201365

darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes: 9.854243889423762

collins and me have a little conversation together: 11.17816280443886

what relates to yourself is as follows: 9.833190129638151

we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye: 12.745252879540713

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time: 10.112336188157954

but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion: 11.08108433552577

it mortifies me: 7.942100292725335

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him: 9.532366472973496

but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not: 10.917550106438759

i think she will: 12.36520076527638

yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office: 8.674974673227934

it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason: 11.646255970240988

collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters: 10.869667759210607

hear me in silence: 15.075453958030584

the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence: 9.343401449933292

anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil: 7.527232956380779

from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce: 11.038107448486647

collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery: 12.085117293539838

not yet replied jane: 11.92131057972727

it is not quite a week since they left brighton: 9.585085043691263

_you_ began the evening well charlotte said mrs: 8.461596938182117

that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance: 9.049376410290897

my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made: 11.712133590545644

gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself: 9.34549570264122

there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name: 12.07273263839757

i am excessively attentive to all those things: 7.944827444533994

elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate: 8.191515725098954

bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all: 7.522227728644541

it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it: 7.034154964112434

and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s: 9.211590419809772

bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr: 8.703753944787994

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment: 8.487095783989062

hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep: 9.453581752585778

cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr: 6.714359454330213

if one could but go to brighton: 7.796621836619088

darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband: 8.272391613312706

georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother: 9.960058476185237

a glass of wine shall i get you one: 6.53289743642847

collins but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it: 8.564932375961588

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile: 9.074145883491875

jane was not happy: 14.64483492538451

indeed: 11.224200802331705

who are your uncles and aunts: 6.780428643207297

assistance is impossible condolence insufferable: 7.188916561840549

this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley: 8.889033198359403

do you often dance at st: 7.473986423379859

lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr: 6.448002433346252

do not let us quarrel about the past: 10.773400453121704

it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey: 8.309245417355767

hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london: 10.256944920747964

after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard: 10.461545745396863

every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr: 5.421064238256785

it was then disclosed in the following manner: 11.29124653195585

i never saw such a long chin in my life: 8.740129434691891

if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better: 17.079166552206186

it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention: 11.137715519494986

she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on: 7.319849866163971

how strange must it appear to him: 8.011689578022526

wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia: 7.685641756839851

she is a very fine looking woman: 9.359055365775951

bingley called again and alone: 10.054603404255763

but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well: 7.926306355427449

he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it: 8.540889631248032

but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king: 8.708325878311738

your s sincerely c: 7.492568325299072

i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections: 10.933677685970778

it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now: 9.219943171971929

chapter xvii: 6.801265390849918

the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment: 11.914500095893363

he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me: 8.830099474060184

long said so too for i asked her whether you did not: 9.877089185000683

you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason: 7.741108673894113

bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight: 7.300822815642687

forster: 16.12004358494379

his debts to be discharged and something still to remain: 9.754818489163782

he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped: 15.580182156815207

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr: 6.915469273519232

she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns: 6.799260631329215

nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole: 10.997154476541649

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother: 13.423290337295942

there is one point on which i want your advice: 10.751099768372649

collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help: 7.813801135963457

recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of: 8.639283539455834

it is too long ago: 9.719609584611

elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr: 8.321694826736964

well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him: 13.789812177188766

such amiable qualities must speak for themselves: 7.8366461973310155

it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before: 9.56476441450207

when i last saw her she was not very promising: 11.829261545241927

to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures: 6.747862393592214

i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent: 9.922507231556553

if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient: 11.619229040361473

his brother in law mr: 8.766601270555489

i never heard any thing so abominable: 8.434878520205444

you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas: 11.356191915211744

he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true: 12.917026741084653

here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse: 7.929919022003508

compliments always take _you_ by surprise and _me_ never: 6.194578676689583

i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly: 7.108584038127355

darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings: 9.120683560296396

mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good: 9.405326492106221

the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room: 8.396772943825118

very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family: 6.670099548164916

i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer: 13.069947384009188

one of them does: 16.845711003628516

it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours: 6.934072653980525

let the other young ladies have time to exhibit: 12.01332665659733

i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away: 10.31686539186057

never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her: 9.292450435015942

but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane: 7.783027527626423

upon my word: 8.16791235171094

no it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr: 11.204779579380268

bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield: 8.67118826443907

did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent: 10.46931563237363

she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it: 7.35781975433544

so imprudent a match on both sides: 6.855590877887559

elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family: 7.72873224963697

the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness: 9.14835530747292

gardiner could do: 9.42228587128584

and what sort of young lady is she: 11.592531234155786

she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject: 7.742557842020334

in a few minutes mrs: 9.115345867802022

bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer: 11.836162250610814

nothing could be more delightful: 12.132072444382375

but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs: 8.357982501503328

i do not deserve it: 7.742554464897542

i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him: 10.091971053491324

she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it: 8.307506248353855

he is so excessively handsome: 9.796582660581413

and what is fifty miles of good road: 9.449143475059445

lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master: 10.745076690192414

then pray speak aloud: 8.45971853626958

the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl: 6.8587532311056405

bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood: 8.946779552233137

he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great: 11.351350749218868

when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr: 6.003575778309227

the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr: 8.333964686938128

his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution: 8.146347639257137

at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies: 7.397936222751602

colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings: 12.408097895620747

those who do not complain are never pitied: 10.23916441005677

it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began: 9.50917538278633

why my dear you must know mrs: 12.384145296091974

are you out of your senses to be accepting this man: 13.440170062921194

a most delightful place: 11.33979371906871

no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me: 9.68454775829249

so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next: 10.63383233904467

does that young lady know mr: 7.8142168307022075

they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain: 11.776809490710981

but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house: 8.44920183340136

as mrs: 10.15401585528787

elizabeth was surprised but said not a word: 8.085262760680681

i quite forgot: 8.474847850840941

long will do any such thing: 10.93635155617375

charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility: 9.04738798852838

and do you impute it to either of those: 12.993943540322089

bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters: 9.388181833848071

and so was i: 9.076566060723376

this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then: 8.976210400341012

as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth: 9.068539901019589

in what an amiable light does this place him: 8.536080004715595

you mistake me my dear: 9.23132926629264

darcy with a very expressive smile: 11.073618885759437

though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here: 10.116462111269323

in the first place replied mr: 8.87021859450039

you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself: 13.23570309982334

it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations: 10.039132116824954

i knew you would be wishing me joy: 9.85569612122372

miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton: 8.918207078015516

the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch: 5.573409683776392

gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs: 5.5926627833697715

but will they make you happy: 6.884355052370762

her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object: 7.365389293641742

collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off: 9.455760990869697

could she have seen half as much love in mr: 11.18402059652902

a few days after this visit mr: 8.503645449170095

but depend upon it mr: 6.82957610410216

with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings: 9.258106288753867

exceed their income: 8.780814140676293

the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune: 6.918028250499131

i shall be back by dinner: 7.666893444839931

dearest jane: 14.025412880889059

what could she mean by it: 9.446276152242705

i must go instantly to my mother she cried: 12.372603274005037

she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings: 6.446735441985114

she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr: 9.027997042240251

you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it: 8.357737643190454

from the entrance hall of which mr: 10.596168991664058

i know it cannot be long: 10.3890899938841

he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house: 9.177120658135351

all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot: 6.590111671145913

but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle: 11.068294759366498

she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together: 8.397553815987761

collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained: 8.034626370503226

observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr: 6.5079028172879845

hurst and elizabeth herself: 13.982891178405145

you never see a fault in any body: 9.91991205748152

the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed: 10.49115516536706

wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps: 11.816713681360577

darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do: 13.468955536422351

gardiner could not be seen and mr: 10.560600299401685

then who taught you: 7.857051831802989

vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled: 6.07197603580606

i will not tell you what it is: 11.66986325022081

i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place: 9.00652757436124

at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way: 11.463028058592458

may we take my uncle s letter to read to her: 11.192208015910824

bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings: 12.167663745671547

thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition: 6.86156133648625

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern: 11.405756562110842

his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others: 11.481717365912909

said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with: 14.13951357228014

the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon: 10.076684474264287

yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise: 12.722303808341405

i think i have heard you say that you know them: 12.581729074184897

conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none: 10.758498303051967

two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day: 10.174590771710335

you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty: 9.102505458895418

miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her: 11.864999815916804

chapter ii: 6.801158777593546

she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did: 9.419050432423973

tell her that you insist upon her marrying him: 12.147198361460683

she was sorry that mr: 7.890277513055864

elizabeth did not know what to make of it: 11.43245229219253

what could become of mr: 7.35176502013842

elizabeth immediately began playing again: 6.391625054302024

if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them: 8.686227146085905

chapter xv: 6.801265390849918

in short i will do my best: 11.933061283349401

as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce: 10.059633187918665

there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable: 9.258474108665823

lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr: 9.195090571698294

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic: 9.12457903444125

i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on: 8.906598914345208

elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word: 7.570271925027693

as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on: 7.646616391158217

in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh: 9.363114573996398

how can mr: 8.42601076007381

when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr: 8.705279807246045

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance: 10.701253375000267

collins in reply to his last: 11.882550495244164

she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here: 10.173019471343633

wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character: 6.26847946658604

what do you think has happened this morning: 8.109525822182402

elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs: 8.27201230688748

gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing: 8.523207412548413

they were in street: 9.773187296882595

really mr: 10.931103275394168

not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room: 9.403639299990106

darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance: 6.898998411141346

at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction: 5.542088163932352

they are my old friends: 7.168888984878112

i have no such injuries to resent: 7.268794738749119

i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about mr: 10.368416392107335

as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza: 10.052710350518462

his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ and his commission purchased: 8.357990227605441

thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me: 9.084075850327501

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose: 12.798575894382648

my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance: 10.598471592336367

i will only add god bless you: 5.643177376831564

elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room: 7.902767851678677

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs: 9.975851779885838

i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name: 6.8529666470272

ii: 16.517640455743866

he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild: 8.620784148867891

but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded: 7.770738972516808

no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject: 10.960165316449643

but now it comes out: 7.150102507936155

if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four of the clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day: 7.414408141200349

i was uncomfortable enough: 7.955575114941372

your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you: 8.522733710556517

the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter: 13.707402254930132

bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home: 11.018456262557134

elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes: 7.231732152612624

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged: 10.31563019807265

of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance: 12.775269906724915

putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way: 10.037528666218417

such a disappointment: 14.670200464947984

he added that mr: 10.005957222322309

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him: 8.045064298052774

if elizabeth when mr: 8.563280078889207

elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view: 7.648092372856118

such doings discomposed mr: 6.141807119747975

what do you mean mr: 8.311340337163534

many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr: 6.704511924619404

kitty run down and order the carriage: 7.854884370820139

certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger: 10.035107799118412

darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable: 9.498635837306766

maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire: 11.49293788189352

he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself: 10.859027396790637

bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all: 9.955983943567366

within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate: 8.95980190895923

yes vanity is a weakness indeed: 9.927653849279846

haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week: 10.404760997085564

collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs: 6.134517326468641

but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr: 8.787574383936006

with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it: 7.668373862836936

but he is a liberal master i suppose and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue: 10.544792080760232

why should they try to influence him: 6.556212360905064

bingley does not know mr: 9.661470312372614

if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it: 9.860102146220575

will you hear it: 10.525771094351269

it was unpardonable: 9.940414196472224

do clear _them_ too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody: 8.460397485272892

they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either: 9.190796314422562

do you really think so: 9.483509851281976

had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage: 9.10462741850367

the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion: 8.480484470687978

collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st: 8.802111663050663

jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day: 11.015331632011987

it is because he will not give himself the trouble: 12.319802909712003

i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat: 12.489764181900634

darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy: 9.593890228841671

she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all: 8.653152393517582

miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room: 7.985852351270012

we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is: 9.16369945087301

but it was not to be: 10.562017094353008

but my dear lydia i do not at all like your going such a way off: 10.6277839307169

certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions: 7.304948370848182

this will not do said elizabeth: 13.761947674851745

darcy was here when you sent for us was it so: 9.666405315302264

that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well: 12.437138967598989

it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them: 6.934085942627821

elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it: 6.692090287238735

i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match cried elizabeth: 11.103366484028012

no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it: 12.899536538073328

indeed mr: 7.824176169600853

do not imagine me ignorant of their condition: 10.565039876078327

for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody: 12.871513712582212

i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject: 9.754586323307333

heaven and earth: 7.980988367298853

collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr: 12.158942395291534

elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes: 10.261944609665369

darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her: 13.960258701827161

how could you begin: 8.123605039175175

elizabeth coloured and said a little: 12.104626739265695

they will have nothing else to do: 11.613408376572577

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr: 8.009367437343156

this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place: 8.011781783898451

or had you intended any more serious consequence: 9.442718120727339

before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs: 12.27503958150217

_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all: 14.10812554982977

poor charlotte: 12.326708154403509

darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right: 11.330611553205298

every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression: 9.665475109577896

she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr: 9.29779377649899

gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday: 13.491601641156882

darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too _little_ she might have fancied too _much_: 8.502652675741501

_my_ father began life in the profession which your uncle mr: 9.360922098048817

wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr: 9.519183017207014

that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr: 9.195472705174623

he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself: 6.581378872279337

but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both: 9.132784719511388

beyond a doubt they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing: 10.476456770723813

darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song: 6.220476533861773

and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty: 9.609544633797825

you may depend upon my not mentioning it: 6.775915683244374

their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection: 8.8144880956504

to yield readily easily to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you: 10.089428844850678

wickham s being among them: 9.974278645517126

said she: 11.907009499762099

let us hope for better things: 6.609778811693643

bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening: 10.887443319639347

is it not clear enough: 10.69127264903158

more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr: 10.2802977451752

i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with: 8.807324502606152

collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go: 7.610622027009133

collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl: 8.675205934720163

it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife: 11.083321832604978

i have said no such thing: 10.047547490073233

bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him: 10.717114832220313

jenkinson s room: 8.998505787507138

the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation: 7.4657624527236965

i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting: 8.948553381528399

chapter i: 8.069198900919174

i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude: 9.402551599748247

every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane: 10.8934159107176

i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all: 9.650990359026279

on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects: 6.908659426156493

he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable: 10.571249366424016

it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded: 10.52855799142609

cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable: 8.828586265043677

the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men: 9.351740306101918

she shook her head: 7.520048111886672

can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it: 9.27369605837138

not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it: 8.819605338331653

darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it: 5.37258630709135

i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly: 9.799439357627174

elizabeth was distressed: 9.473367451625924

end of vol: 10.49666460309982

we will go round the park every day: 8.414064384254697

miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr: 9.885258767686457

lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance: 8.816471487593207

colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object: 9.938036537051023

but of every other neglect i can believe him capable: 10.811153883441092

i do not know who is good enough for him: 7.884784167098049

my good kind brother: 10.264139170789532

and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner: 10.894561469486213

bennet are not they: 12.319464815404405

how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt: 13.17283721490885

gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr: 12.328740260869786

not one: 15.869436306701106

it would have been strange if they had: 10.016434684127441

you know i have: 14.829696079441002

i see the imprudence of it: 9.352882417398224

darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr: 12.730706033841289

he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits: 10.264471934997747

how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other: 11.660614936512985

they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade: 8.768341749664586

not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs: 10.793137748768917

colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon: 7.104515521932099

on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor: 11.131937862063884

when this was done she had a less active part to play: 11.22376550726324

well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next: 9.520895625160048

they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine: 9.22778470201413

it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas: 9.435490585858368

but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness: 11.181042856757687

but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem: 8.978775678258728

yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside: 7.6495467757507845

oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened: 8.066456534228276

and i have another favour to ask: 10.647465811796208

_you_ wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body: 12.745526079754846

darcy made no answer: 7.025149196105892

long has just been here and she told me all about it: 10.581870052826313

the latter was thinking only of his breakfast: 12.475622114029722

so handsome: 15.105174028406495

he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things: 7.810543411409864

bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable: 6.138145555810387

with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning: 7.433328118967844

it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week: 9.911949610256967

it was all pride and insolence: 8.905643821552207

can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties: 6.541973257503391

besides there was truth in his looks: 15.75842231924076

was not this some excuse for incivility if i _was_ uncivil: 9.104502324345255

but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate: 7.4288675263501895

i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from _you_: 8.04425179904878

the comfort to _her_ of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression: 8.995917284811823

i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe: 8.522407892700285

when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that _i_ might have prevented it: 9.050580569070469

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs: 7.737835749466453

do not keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake: 6.247685155402313

soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately: 10.358886268146229

gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever: 8.648491113804294

there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again: 8.4963455887928

as to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not _know_ of any prepossession her _eldest_ daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged: 10.387566710287675

i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books: 8.82310930349297

bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter: 9.778913091534458

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr: 7.309695835222708

i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow: 9.724924598668672

her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined: 15.05087213886769

no she would go home: 13.14431342704714

it is well: 10.005579237741037

bennet and the children: 14.4350369763144

a: 14.507912536845827

when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her: 7.999604481671431

when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so: 10.193190366177909

easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important: 10.93731096770606

darcy speaking to her: 11.271412716632023

gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well: 6.048698238290552

i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal: 8.586488659169724

it is evident that you belong to the first circles: 13.426910097050518

jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare: 8.381752296903779

when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least: 10.795941273604157

accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me: 12.43135573333732

you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage: 7.647581107426732

it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth: 14.200316753939806

i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them: 11.61882491840355

we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago: 10.074906883954045

your idea of the ponies is delightful: 12.010618626164954

lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer: 11.655759840478146

wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry: 7.484845054425802

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy: 14.523880256481519

i shall go distracted: 7.105009624558094

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste: 5.960862689330558

collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure: 10.594656435189416

collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent: 8.858332932541655

this was agreed to and mrs: 8.40221754773335

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr: 5.159712433420255

her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter: 7.472511024426543

darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable: 6.839029876954137

darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me: 7.728544250228582

it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to: 11.256740660556027

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity: 8.586071032895838

miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth: 9.096933880585613

wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented: 13.2285079995335

you shall have it in few words: 11.949684297113798

miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard: 10.1518547648422

even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr: 7.580273607926105

i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things: 7.437564405466486

darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him: 11.610875312482719

her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home: 14.533317085026603

the first part of mrs: 10.6740602300417

international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states: 5.022348110644129

darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak: 8.678122727270098

that his two sisters and mr: 10.917235154647685

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour: 11.227064091438717

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs: 9.220972092362624

for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter: 13.552039492018647

they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited: 8.965201423880194

i do not wish to avoid the walk: 9.543594717232248

repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed: 6.716232562477762

gardiner but perhaps to the lakes: 14.462072710045772

besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight: 9.360172442335616

he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book: 9.404990227813707

i certainly saw mr: 7.1398594772992405

perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often: 13.036995303442916

i am sure my sisters must all envy me: 5.696481406532893

darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner: 9.203754528310467

the officers will find women better worth their notice: 6.590554280386907

does he know his real character: 7.518878884625011

darcy had walked away to another part of the room: 9.537916227588962

no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical: 15.159516874040923

cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves: 10.914895506347007

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment: 6.454455613312076

if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents: 14.14109048014312

as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable: 14.38601548837778

after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr: 10.102617495431085

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr: 5.755753912602532

money: 19.920860682203486

you dislike an argument and want to silence this: 6.849179453871749

but enough of this: 12.825973174319637

pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive: 8.975978368106995

i always said it must be so at last: 10.810642010272007

what is he coming home and without poor lydia: 9.999262947653618

but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede: 10.726025241312456

miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty: 10.717807527791079

but why all this secrecy: 10.21438737006423

collins were once silent: 6.688338564662841

elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply: 10.545464976155795

it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in: 6.5347244452387105

her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie: 12.297447704933

she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr: 7.191805214676069

do you know mr: 10.47147295506371

i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return: 9.034418622092009

by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration: 9.829311264052322

darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea: 7.955207934098289

wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them is less certain: 6.77963085205661

we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield: 7.216696179904349

this is the estimation in which you hold me: 9.962795961727945

this cannot be: 11.344854730442508

she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her: 12.675885348967705

her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them: 8.786167270701796

darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet: 11.706196661685103

he has not an ill natured look: 9.812558696887915

bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family: 9.794174642634704

elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her: 11.358373743999946

royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section <NUM> information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation: 6.189221055911679

and what did she say: 12.69177401676246

darcy then was: 10.39476997620624

elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself: 8.714212142267808

her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much: 8.06175704005602

here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown: 11.405370160822999

you can _now_ have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered: 7.910139094688747

my dearest sister now _be_ be serious: 5.893828796244611

at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself: 9.062973311030978

elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation: 8.018257480338708

but think no more of the letter: 13.218776207280941

he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible: 10.35787636576327

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes: 9.339220847089086

it became her turn to listen: 10.0731581320551

if he no longer cares for me why silent: 8.559312332948906

charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth: 9.643276589679184

i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading: 8.170673301718955

your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land: 9.287580800369497

in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings: 9.465399600701778

it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment: 8.175657953373557

and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman: 8.696731450798033

what is there of good to be expected: 13.761739157475631

can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him: 7.988175463959526

the girls stared at their father: 10.95604673883684

say that urgent business calls us home immediately: 6.6276757235733195

collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs: 6.841860877231481

oh lord: 7.278676304272551

he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy: 8.022233938796614

my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr: 6.862244721710314

to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add: 11.544661523071804

implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character: 7.328096854585049

his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling: 16.127711896876196

it is a pity they are not handsome: 10.610145139192188

the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained: 7.011317986294231

chapter xxiii: 8.950968636090755

lord: 14.299098800746401

you deserve no such attention: 9.860487721628896

she is a great deal too ill to be moved: 10.572165786364149

i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure: 9.462942506312352

yet it did and even a third: 11.301502977948537

he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn: 11.521406918758466

but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere: 8.089669975986022

if he does not come to me _then_ said she i shall give him up for ever: 11.322406006297923

by this time she is actually with them: 12.099599804019654

from the former: 16.919884853519534

was not a man to be trusted: 20.679101417484212

jenkinson were sitting: 9.481382163803778

_ dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance: 8.136163056520733

bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else: 8.972995450268002

bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr: 6.234074562137068

but the wife of mr: 6.386780426576989

there was no help for it however: 11.387426617008549

bennet came from it: 10.314181594525403

anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr: 7.416518452033032

of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity: 10.241687030760898

hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of: 11.743078945184537

she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it: 8.769035039536043

bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn: 9.594735374633057

it would have suited me in every respect: 10.1024618990588

but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation: 15.274536949275884

bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure: 12.208772805663457

pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night: 5.993306711422137

wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as _they_ were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room: 6.360378538911275

conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible: 9.801638557384225

who attended to you: 13.625422031295143

i have by no means done: 8.461388405254965

i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs: 9.689884566130534

i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers: 8.65130443525179

the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be: 8.891863201397566

lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way: 16.249385858460805

bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome: 9.396881966562425

gardiner s long letter but now having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write: 9.599064305481994

it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace: 11.219663065197032

do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm: 5.903527896326778

but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them: 6.433033161172832

well how pleased i am: 9.545309292722411

she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him: 10.660011124461098

his disposition must be dreadful: 12.849608030558652

elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father: 8.628331657604058

when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr: 8.284840373514903

he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand: 10.016092942407699

i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud _i_ have seen nothing of it: 7.3243006870225535

are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet: 12.261728156272477

bennet by admiring mrs: 5.7990459795597955

you know nothing of the matter: 12.509144493153599

in the intervals of her discourse with mrs: 10.805769822687505

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth: 10.143866986457102

secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness: 9.292344785528325

copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change: 8.513418479832026

from what we have seen of him continued mrs: 12.507822649438122

their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush: 9.01307996288691

she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr: 7.727058620466398

at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr: 10.858327785717247

after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud: 7.983926222289195

he was well but so much engaged with mr: 11.198724076424526

we can all _begin_ freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement: 8.148410362063126

yes very different: 10.730340081169782

so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper or _her_ affectionate heart: 7.039217384715244

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view: 10.154509991661405

bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself: 7.975409877782257

i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham _i_ can hardly be just to him: 8.464492917869567

my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it: 9.590096990823294

they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them: 8.287279577175676

and for _this_ we are to be thankful: 13.472255808105311

she could have added a young man too like _you_ whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner: 8.236583179770427

at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr: 7.003208928947993

it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill: 8.458642857859083

there is not a bit of fish to be got to day: 9.781163644530903

what are men to rocks and mountains: 5.549222952325675

bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr: 9.926404049030623

you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him: 8.906978163951944

his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again: 6.638534330227036

there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works: 5.864832610404379

it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning: 10.731463063730267

i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children: 7.596688661241715

_their_ situation was awkward enough but _her s_ she thought was still worse: 6.20408563491632

i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs: 11.829367875165614

as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness: 12.15540585482411

but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there: 8.675976032213464

here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery: 7.31511256159988

and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together: 10.677170183918014

but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle: 11.953461042248552

it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining: 8.697522209936771

she was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before: 8.773980274562742

she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners: 8.275267651000467

collins was wishing to marry you: 9.34825301059664

however i recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr: 7.296565545382051

the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them: 8.126113287072453

society i own is necessary to me: 9.085665623100114

i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles: 11.794911942850488

my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us: 7.841300883183086

her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense: 11.46928157757376

and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection: 12.582251379349918

but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them: 10.172863666482048

she was at least free from the offence of mr: 9.479326842166529

his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars: 13.439268828340095

bennet s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library: 9.566754407364556

_they_ will take care not to outrun their income: 8.458750139398393

had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind: 10.76305818567959

the envelope itself was likewise full: 5.827728964836262

i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage: 8.973223575401557

gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again: 8.200041236817484

but i will no longer importune my young cousin: 7.37811208256066

its completion depended on others: 6.253657313151857

that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive _his_ pride if he had not mortified _mine_: 10.633583274680415

had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr: 9.549576813223524

to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal: 7.621743776233824

bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable: 10.089303069202137

bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before: 10.221759496096077

and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me: 9.273266010766104

it may do very well for the others replied mr: 11.253858720469752

in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself: 7.629787346921048

her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world: 12.130058338943266

the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence: 9.992656900318202

they found mr: 8.555023082551271

cried wickham with a look which did not escape her: 11.513175019272689

now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits: 10.589626624625046

but it is always so: 12.517658299244657

no indeed: 11.589737235926439

your s very sincerely m: 7.551216148286347

the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished: 11.607561259083871

after tea mr: 8.777965543947301

yes very well: 9.211205141373295

but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me: 11.787538368390438

_he_ was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain: 11.51507269717452

he was full of joy and attention: 8.728763732607609

let her go then: 8.534655637351305

but these things happen so often: 7.579762761415096

well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say: 11.55690231325915

it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could _feel_ gratitude i would now thank you: 9.137876263491854

she has two nieces of her own: 11.1575285217543

the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt: 13.712851804385489

with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many: 8.561058688796198

i speak feelingly: 8.883977750772434

elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame: 9.659965281251218

lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern: 8.087975387780059

darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr: 6.714116377783091

nonsense how can you talk so: 8.889166806718656

it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess: 9.098340810123743

she did indeed louisa: 9.171151300589004

their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp: 7.112838619679212

there was another reason too for her opposition: 11.173956203694122

you may imagine what i felt and how i acted: 11.564912051975298

the particulars i reserve till we meet: 7.706155633708813

the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger: 12.278085812153341

darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room: 8.73009299927953

my dear continued mrs: 7.079512132518333

these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed: 12.031793001342514

wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr: 8.623836598916109

no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else: 9.858559784694435

but i must write no more: 10.654475485566918

she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend: 10.684502728620652

oh that i knew how it was: 14.461025527233428

the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike: 8.572144574752095

he was very fond of them: 10.481542306937984

he is perfectly amiable: 10.651003466015581

_you_ go to brighton: 9.1849665310574

you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it: 12.38468588143907

nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth: 12.868255717230806

i will take care of myself and of mr: 8.65815419907554

would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress: 8.134450867606736

in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on: 8.808681631163779

our poor mother is sadly grieved: 7.800970682424116

hurst and mr: 6.9990616503027505

she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange: 11.156402311867483

as often as i can: 16.098139680823195

ah: 11.452771295083007

his attachment to rosings certainly increases: 8.529036774222686

she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr: 8.281294286973829

jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth: 12.069311423913955

upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself: 9.758048765063899

they were ignorant idle and vain: 7.348622883651644

all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry: 13.898753673828043

he has always something to say to every body: 10.38202034557046

her reflections were in general satisfactory: 12.645161612235759

yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but _that_ was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance: 10.81481040463975

collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten: 9.885952607855222

bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you: 12.108647396178286

can it be really so: 10.081401575080369

colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out: 10.719415384085648

in <NUM> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations: 4.518772205111496

your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters: 10.539364551068795

my dear hill have you heard the good news: 8.518223056724553

nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery: 9.590524081966294

jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever: 14.800820578384995

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys: 12.138685129804358

she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr: 7.5251335834252595

and then we were so merry all the way home: 11.29443503724207

bingley if he _had been_ imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public: 9.395743210818148

you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <NUM>: 4.480911177164302

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed: 8.473082828655004

you take delight in vexing me: 6.462704446877607

as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring: 11.931536065001794

who would have thought she could be so thin and small: 11.791964811947446

darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her: 11.696782863778305

to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs: 7.9400990499844655

she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him: 11.88007783304208

his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing: 8.104767615785686

it was gratitude: 10.517786987791588

i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful: 8.368979247688555

forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home: 9.427729201146366

this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much: 11.14018806213855

bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane: 7.005820128297855

her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr: 8.756812851769341

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short: 9.177328240087924

how rich and how great you will be: 10.619986481663883

yours c: 8.797841667127729

i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady: 8.96556333725903

yes: 9.220623175163682

and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married: 9.412977994883212

i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it: 10.881211971404356

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself: 8.418069991250462

she really looked almost wild: 7.606484866600808

elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly: 9.448510584574983

and this is always the way with him she added: 16.87807414997049

b: 17.348014351258197

darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away: 10.381254880648482

i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands: 11.53571632302247

repeated elizabeth in utter amazement: 8.884971408105248

her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered: 12.476169968985774

yes or i will never see her again: 10.685235846828844

his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing: 11.658945363796054

bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could: 10.374938641872186

do you suppose them to be in london: 11.967759199610338

i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference: 9.262570667242832

bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his: 6.038924837098042

many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing: 9.005318556074759

her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr: 9.55161305754715

she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teazing than usual to himself: 8.344349755857358

having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so: 6.236483949736051

if your master would marry you might see more of him: 8.750499489319846

her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it: 8.347650551767456

darcy had been staying there: 10.032129672032866

her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable: 9.379952638199653

bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits: 7.94295744691811

he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds: 10.507541112959396

if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is derived from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges: 6.2002169549369475

darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself: 10.229332334273362

that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr: 7.9000321796818245

but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity: 9.692585170347892

since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head: 8.734022323756324

bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice: 8.353760876986493

she dared not relate the other half of mr: 8.200178521099422

intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done: 17.48903650177924

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence: 8.972747095251233

collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you: 10.732214709543324

he has heartily forgiven me now: 6.478885551545777

hate you: 12.730668184239217

i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine: 9.46908554774171

wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece: 5.41966684008955

but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her: 11.173579847974136

she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise: 7.46150218584139

darcy might have done as well: 10.881716537993961

with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr: 8.321554243017964

you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself: 8.86965852225876

i dare say i shall soon see them here: 7.707403839465405

jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it: 8.685715897429743

how unlucky: 10.916402269170382

bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt: 11.091563137674639

not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement: 9.989372781834478

the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them: 12.201621353055678

elizabeth replied that it was: 12.637779100346268

cried miss bingley: 9.806073618751979

this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs: 12.720341843350658

bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man: 8.587743687322636

its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn: 7.330585237237609

i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge: 10.076496658681597

the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly: 5.654707449388156

bennet said only nonsense nonsense: 6.1980908222410624

his character is thereby complete: 8.179910854701932

the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point: 7.981700509186066

but you how are you: 11.334015056269333

go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks: 10.605306902412023

it was hardly enough but it pleased her: 10.768968613667845

send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly: 8.17098543753985

were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain: 10.975387037574585

if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon: 14.164008824973196

elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her: 7.413044235045584

you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income: 8.574581384294367

and _that_ is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr: 12.390284197609622

darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr: 8.129504325528345

his father was an excellent man said mrs: 9.177135179690856

yes _that_ is what makes it amusing: 7.353964047146113

said he as he joined her: 14.455538230276863

but no such recollection befriended her: 7.006159788565125

elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express: 5.65631710848148

excuse me for i must speak plainly: 16.194761326379954

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her: 13.22936074114989

my dear charlotte impossible: 7.921792911172834

_i_ never saw such a woman: 12.691324327280524

i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind: 9.263891427751537

when is your next ball to be lizzy: 12.288138713548767

collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy: 12.499501668245639

human nature is so prone to fall into it: 7.296514197691367

they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family: 7.954814449697704

bennet began repeating her thanks to mr: 5.6943470280108

i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable: 9.789870254352248

as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr: 7.906181853288784

it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection: 7.241610531742372

collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn: 7.726272265181744

_that_ is a failing indeed: 10.919729474527092

darcy she moved again towards the gate: 7.564504334644252

but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out: 10.990352736932593

her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way: 10.782468132345185

the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with mrs: 6.770869107744445

she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr: 10.285269831161717

in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man: 6.7348027575708

and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses: 5.774610816154461

he drew a chair near her: 7.807956395570046

mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day: 8.623673103585157

to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment: 8.769240039062272

this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr: 8.805815622683902

and when you have given _your_ ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also: 9.937003470547726

she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she _meant_ well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours: 8.355278326714043

project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify do copyright research on transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg tm collection: 4.140780621301347

i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit: 7.896769656344457

very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same: 10.702804482591706

is there nothing you could take to give you present relief: 9.391926493357937

he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening: 12.28318232496379

bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again: 9.210083719000274

well then supposing them to be in london: 10.421341683388796

shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her: 8.354804685266917

i cannot believe it: 8.881262493505123

she practises very constantly: 7.205748946756604

the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this: 9.830635165263677

then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind: 6.78023444384149

see <NUM> h: 8.510981055979496

here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind: 5.433013924417547

it is nearly fifty miles: 7.342099557576225

it was really a very handsome thought: 10.731512011721241

this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend: 11.404503702451985

she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther: 9.759513620232099

the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do: 10.796326891132034

her ease and good spirits increased: 9.849927287934127

darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find: 11.964158983693505

my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due: 9.364808881583148

those who chose to be idle certainly might: 10.827408285383644

elizabeth on her side had much to do: 12.283263475491244

collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear: 10.70601861592817

as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all mr: 11.106439956350641

i shall see her again: 8.228416858883794

and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice: 13.588588392207571

elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph: 9.937296824565966

it is done however and it was done for the best: 15.427952340970956

brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton: 6.488374951312828

darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home: 10.660410841824213

but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person: 6.56762472009604

they met several times for there was much to be discussed: 13.545776720416635

bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn: 9.211599922761328

i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak: 8.511697161065166

reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old: 10.004504359241144

elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not: 11.542380589243978

as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship: 9.989743021923994

at night she opened her heart to jane: 8.869718436766929

i am sure you must feel it so: 8.938130472539235

but good lord: 7.984204160179884

from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs: 9.051354625784365

and what can _he_ have to say: 9.196834842680746

you shall hear what she says: 11.314589094291208

upon my word said mrs: 6.626373576586507

we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off: 7.736026667990085

darcy has never seen the view: 8.725525141120952

we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall: 12.930999733611864

how can they suit each other: 7.132377926467331

she repeated: 12.373271302853341

it had better have happened to _you_ lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner: 11.810002544050908

but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me: 5.922615619058377

miss bennet i am shocked and astonished: 9.406772195567951

miss bennet i insist on being satisfied: 7.599927323300798

while sir william was with them mr: 8.494237572098703

she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs: 9.689752551929523

had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr: 10.320342325288385

i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer: 8.343467533904773

it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first: 8.076699777498334

collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr: 11.09787750551832

that tall proud man: 7.7600092369675995

no one but mrs: 9.454232747319075

nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece: 10.30246423027267

then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet: 6.40030805520733

pray how _violent was_ mr: 4.813027036936554

it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture: 8.252643354463014

those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs: 9.000650639431075

gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn: 7.720721518277639

collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton: 9.236255498295876

i dare say you will find him very agreeable: 9.949378048862908

it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush: 9.195483213984613

the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence: 7.431538887447566

i am sorry to say it of them but so it is: 12.792202300527785

i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it: 7.828303489599698

i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i _should_ be looked at: 12.215053526620363

the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty: 8.515191192595196

such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them: 10.063085789843653

must it be so: 15.361245597590784

lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room: 9.69012580520404

if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence: 10.763754739547181

bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high: 10.258890797871194

not all that mrs: 15.171782486928937

anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn: 9.772295863089113

but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves: 9.687020700452365

where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil: 7.4662822326622225

but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising: 11.905763262339088

reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends: 10.784313562323575

gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends: 11.064273539726537

i guessed as much: 10.162556623774677

it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind: 7.8683448245048435

egerton military library whitehall: 5.042727974736748

the part which i acted is now to be explained: 14.83217162139855

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr: 12.278571060197335

but i confess they would have no charms for _me_: 10.133675592285421

she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour: 7.1977469341310085

his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire: 9.049869212291224

it seems an hopeless business: 7.09002793553685

i do not remember her name among the ladies at court: 7.346300033866848

the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s: 9.200310190704874

bingley s heart were entertained: 7.890075964722273

unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg <NUM>: 8.45388578688627

if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen: 12.317960767968968

darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner: 7.4147515446015895

by mrs: 10.295443914019634

how near it may be to _mine_ i cannot pretend to say: 9.756688693842817

charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard: 12.009350508136091

amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life: 10.242508077464326

good girl: 14.358186926059085

there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care: 9.687207663493124

at length she spoke again: 9.130068109621492

perhaps that is not possible for any one: 13.651361078674809

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother: 6.933241187120531

during dinner mr: 9.880293296464426

oh jane take care: 8.61972897839524

philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr: 7.950556022382463

but however that shall not prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined: 10.835429129198939

the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him: 9.165237977877792

the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter: 13.66459220868452

collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs: 10.307310133489036

i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law: 7.072527857775751

do you prefer reading to cards: 6.964283741303061

darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way: 9.231843040954764

she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success: 8.87977844445001

i want to talk very seriously: 9.887392131821514

i had not believed it possible: 10.145969462031157

at present we have nothing to guide us: 10.186802923569745

she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield: 7.744221118782597

not that i am afraid of _myself_ but i dread other people s remarks: 8.538880677978133

lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour: 8.94866465433356

a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love: 6.832738458605943

and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body: 7.5969349064998895

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement: 9.748556102749497

bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c: 10.620137819730271

we passed each other several times: 9.545324361443605

if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however: 12.129955154497628

your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth: 10.14810948603514

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs: 9.664563992817403

limited warranty disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph <NUM>: 4.9439836401963335

and what is your success: 11.119792951165477

her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family: 10.454668063264899

she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs: 9.946199280208432

his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself: 11.829218686998582

when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister: 12.165622877558945

on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid: 7.548838509928312

you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken: 7.7153330991297056

but what does he say of the living: 12.522227363160267

you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice: 7.940240545005319

james s: 8.811373527756869

philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs: 8.927557535382732

on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion: 10.195010869975864

_that_ will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on _me_: 10.89287505698797

do not you darcy: 11.458648476431101

thoughtless thoughtless lydia: 8.110369885856787

her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating: 8.730417217944026

and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs: 10.561082304075656

and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did: 10.133341942432455

how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family: 8.231678302039045

he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty: 7.360599821505534

what will you think of my vanity: 16.51510461945688

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr: 12.83070334407019

replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before: 9.290226296379153

indeed he has no improper pride: 11.051535544562736

does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly: 10.201334569079187

oh lizzy: 8.687934236573113

bingley and jane: 9.716979203775205

miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps: 12.400070325515625

your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage: 8.061772560529993

collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours: 10.950579870879622

that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare: 12.183840723306211

cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment: 8.019629144257935

it is more than i engage for i assure you: 9.905600472058186

but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief: 7.280469734947747

after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr: 7.423145185295974

how he must have felt it: 15.423475949889754

yes very handsome: 9.481337707969503

on saturday he came again: 10.107542480856829

but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money: 7.509567059644383

his reception however was of the most flattering kind: 12.716343496737595

to pemberley therefore they were to go: 10.89830253949744

bennet for any thing about the entail: 12.010443809057401

my dear aunt how could you think of it: 8.797844265550816

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs: 7.487894315888568

he should be particularly happy at any time c: 8.484786050794533

teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind: 6.190035324044621

she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk: 12.68569130956159

kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon: 6.430912979287068

it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts: 8.23319042262802

darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words: 9.19351988465633

collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him: 12.210782402520014

but the case is this: 12.355977139215414

he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived: 11.747055873646389

i grieve to find however that colonel f: 8.983992902089817

while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family: 9.55476797387054

as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too: 9.598348203059782

you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing: 9.933126740739793

he bore it however with admirable calmness: 7.248703628804179

it did: 14.320679411068795

had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort: 9.186459846871736

bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly: 11.001360786703739

chapter xiv: 6.801265390849918

elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it: 7.660752107986692

they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other: 8.413015622651196

he keeps a man servant does he: 9.24686497551816

darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner: 11.15191494082378

they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight: 7.624212160525589

do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense: 8.660203097755883

i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers: 14.894294272530356

denny comes back from town: 7.657641018250649

your sister i also watched: 9.020989285715356

i promised them so faithfully: 7.409114764182624

she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess: 10.813618191487247

we can all plague and punish one another: 5.4288871749022665

my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise: 8.932489551770205

he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said: 13.071552003870865

darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost: 9.152485229484142

darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came: 12.495959091208777

they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life: 10.054298274077365

darcy mentioned his letter: 9.536345250734374

he made no answer: 7.62584867964201

i cannot blame myself for having done thus much: 7.888605498796066

she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations: 11.28646694858081

darcy after enquiring of her how mr: 9.885103418781098

how abominable: 11.099128455586078

she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr: 8.910113840514414

as long as she stays there it is all very well: 11.014121189683255

he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st: 7.175227716134454

that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling: 9.393859231622734

gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr: 8.701215590745

my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken: 8.2119957149601

the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly: 7.982519618090808

the path just admitted three: 6.6619215262639395

how good it was in you my dear mr: 11.335868879002964

i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel: 9.635474107492916

nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister: 10.464655455187112

the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door: 11.531457156460373

i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him: 8.066284398955494

a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation: 7.050835172148592

i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not: 9.251991352886316

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt: 10.113017074343308

darcy returned within the stated time: 6.9369720245380355

such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth: 8.970245676239843

what is it you are talking of: 14.442200100752066

i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness: 8.845648853973923

she will be married at sixteen: 10.434008938406063

and i certainly _never_ shall give it: 10.159755448218542

it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard: 7.245823388992056

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate: 8.910635286438964

the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten: 9.573861670836246

that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr: 8.869712836695896

i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly: 9.632677338798416

if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once: 8.550760666893018

it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast: 5.891199325976727

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together: 9.187083044346949

mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library: 7.6531245674434585

i was in the middle before i knew that i _had_ begun: 12.232698699401638

and now here s mr: 7.484106160698228

they walked on without knowing in what direction: 9.27933528512911

if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law: 6.429847713309006

all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again: 9.108917093281205

darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true: 8.752468326344266

he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security: 6.519285102787267

having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report: 10.624938132059478

jane was so admired nothing could be like it: 12.062802576711645

you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you: 7.418366102207896

they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr: 6.529685553373993

those were your words: 8.877900218235455

he could not speak a word for full ten minutes: 8.866086856469998

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr: 6.896942939094913

he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty: 10.454726838550506

you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness: 5.223996487000628

i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression: 9.463655402043338

she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous: 8.880190931837513

darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property: 13.972304289750756

lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone: 8.971638883018407

its business office is located at <NUM> north <NUM> west salt lake city ut <NUM> <PHONENO>: 3.4280055978120623

his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear: 8.746940009938557

i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly: 9.860000136707765

_that_ is all to be forgot: 18.046205613841845

elizabeth silently attended her: 9.030001456287463

you have done all this: 11.0445767082441

how wonderfully these sort of things occur: 7.566765642461049

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that _one_ only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject: 9.28042239034469

our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast: 6.239276874117438

bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent: 7.97616231266607

we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured: 7.623211273452349

darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it: 6.123302221732455

i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter: 9.614821023576841

darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again: 8.71800841273695

every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight: 10.928368104605957

he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning: 11.658169922622566

darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr: 9.643741678825252

i had much rather go in the coach: 10.491586445907096

she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs: 7.794296435069226

elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it: 9.430503746312665

but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for: 12.300243827611581

i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr: 7.286356529570622

darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only: 10.568195225344295

but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came: 7.477173195069277

with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations: 12.487572894931455

but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune: 7.49988131255355

she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost: 10.149072389319365

she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr: 11.692945421478258

collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr: 11.353803520139284

the next was in these words: 13.219724015915377

i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows: 8.686904710972541

though her manner varied however her determination never did: 6.642164784383885

they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it: 7.178045568626694

thank god: 11.20908946970623

htm or <NUM> h: 7.886128315775946

it was dated from rosings at eight of the clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you: 7.888421347704207

make haste make haste: 10.853613614131497

with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected: 10.20077808908164

i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr: 7.696021247538946

such very superior dancing is not often seen: 12.438042283333978

darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself: 11.896778027204183

i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr: 9.63561610448457

and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth: 9.6226972120503

hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out: 7.854058624609451

collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman: 9.148203147261176

we seem to have been designed for each other: 8.962056616475873

he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister: 9.90483178032048

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been: 10.261249808533655

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet: 10.32539537901565

collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them: 8.69632015513273

all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading: 10.496732948681593

any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr: 8.607951555044908

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once: 11.980596943339519

but do not imagine that he is always here so often: 11.828537448462692

elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight: 9.638980054616264

and my mother how is she: 11.672453553609166

bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter: 9.1946077153172

nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true: 10.483349992104966

they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it: 10.607678656043635

she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter: 9.45253287314187

it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country: 9.638795015267469

and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it: 10.35486395854646

but the gentlemen will have mr: 10.536359098506693

in understanding darcy was the superior: 13.388425422629627

not that i _shall_ though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out: 9.676841889950534

she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself: 9.625598061260453

there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr: 6.176396360953426

the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news: 8.933655317923202

darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house: 9.2104722706461

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her: 6.11901804757458

but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name: 8.032094875087576

she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again: 10.727443323800902

whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure: 14.58561665154841

are you much acquainted with mr: 8.542517144829976

you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him: 6.493001991605925

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned: 10.616959946354223

but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment: 14.78705184025306

but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years: 8.36576860016481

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr: 8.802466468153545

that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny: 11.531286966653603

but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent: 12.870044637401671

she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation: 6.801862611014062

and is it really true: 11.499192145129454

another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away: 8.415045632370932

you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works provided that you pay a royalty fee of <NUM> of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes: 5.235938347621154

this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret: 6.9897012227565485

_you_ were mr: 8.00001274114863

collins then returned to elizabeth: 11.304895476145907

but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other: 9.41579939739269

i had often seen him in love before: 13.463548017160054

will you do me the honour of reading that letter: 11.702055020953017

charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time: 13.870802639016798

darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend: 10.40168454669631

darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life: 8.909726388065048

his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad: 9.366348740507336

she was overpowered by shame and vexation: 6.350115807557769

elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives: 9.210262189034067

poor dear child: 9.796545534517241

i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding: 11.211724007532093

however little mr: 9.063286697678988

the officer was the very mr: 12.95880147366334

as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents: 8.616860809743946

were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me: 12.015712935490487

give me farther particulars: 13.927201698334871

elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away: 8.46378507934952

i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you: 7.933454809932333

bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it: 9.659498368599927

yes i understand you perfectly: 7.637963229481909

this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree: 11.910668076057485

his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion: 7.017728366870429

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr: 6.8192902351856794

collins s conversation to herself: 7.449085560885638

it is of all subjects my delight: 8.657151426849394

if mr: 8.759508949284347

of a fine stout healthy love it may: 10.841475248668432

bingley in consequence of it before _they_ did: 10.738058123320915

neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight: 9.96263802849566

at length however mrs: 7.07268077670003

bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife: 12.906242906103392

it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt: 9.199961485973576

if this be the case he deserves you: 9.239428563078903

yes she called yesterday with her father: 9.781647537140223

on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities: 9.935053641743975

she did indeed: 10.793806926646129

darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love: 8.759269397172048

let me hear from you very soon: 7.980274347270462

darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way: 12.497938827029307

you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased: 7.826378113489259

i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible: 10.00930514008414

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within: 9.022400395841867

there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be: 9.995838118029853

it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy: 9.100390428838608

in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before: 9.390460841687773

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now: 7.363266209652931

collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man: 8.44362804267554

i am all astonishment: 7.946799493814504

how could he spare half ten thousand pounds: 6.118133564206135

they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride: 7.096980967363249

bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only: 8.03725224810344

he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business: 10.81311689181183

seriously i would have you be on your guard: 14.702205429350828

darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr: 12.924073369028932

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs: 13.125432020569322

you are too hasty sir she cried: 6.556496199346302

i saw them the night before last: 8.90670752046468

from mr: 9.715733058271377

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth: 11.815812250260569

their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s: 12.421288156928481

how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him: 6.565790267844712

collins and mr: 6.7945770293462395

imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_: 6.796115597089977

elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him: 10.077160682996603

aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to: 10.847869086068389

in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room: 10.908725608458141

but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err: 6.833750150254563

can he be a sensible man sir: 11.40193573324349

and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good added kitty: 8.611440186443897

yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr: 8.296369233452008

bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness: 10.285178315660074

elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs: 6.372304920746715

that is a question which mr: 8.930171424344476

indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them: 10.46509232064483

this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr: 11.076578277696022

collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh: 7.980014361437726

newby chief executive and director gbnewby <MENTION> section <NUM>: 3.2979645259471546

you provide in accordance with paragraph <NUM>: 5.036528461421687

darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough: 11.721270660715465

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr: 8.719974311802085

their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this: 7.233095982791825

darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm: 8.030957210311904

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections: 7.843228890975462

wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going: 11.679403556171552

but our visitor was very obstinate: 9.552970267920323

all field sports were over: 6.810574486386519

rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit: 10.764842642528182

elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants: 13.373374380400323

and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason: 9.000321451817591

how does georgiana get on darcy: 6.583058975107361

had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps: 8.853127381123835

you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within <NUM> days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg tm license: 6.6565393343539805

collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking: 9.957342460597733

elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was: 10.93029002280227

stone: 18.375460359549194

it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours: 11.401448753554257

when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were: 10.735125099902035

with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success: 11.267640722059499

your tempers are by no means unlike: 7.068604923521176

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling: 12.582293875178854

its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs: 7.861654139504228

so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find: 10.677343414729828

i am very glad you liked her: 7.091829955309644

on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared: 8.0949882447587

chapter xi: 7.526837439137147

but do not be cast down: 10.316260957016521

this is my advice: 11.081117653083354

nothing could console and nothing appease her: 7.375354039273523

they repulsed every attempt of mrs: 5.792243897397608

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first: 8.405278432867389

you had much better dance: 11.905027286862962

we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon: 7.470518128686834

her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh: 10.467315354884338

but at least it shews that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey: 11.212253482322836

bennet was stirring the fire: 6.227798288778772

very nonsensical to come at all: 9.411928266404002

he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere: 7.130131018100775

your father of course may spare you if your mother can: 8.946274841191245

do not wish me such an evil: 10.925107577146944

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr: 10.47120494881193

when is your turn to come: 10.20146125634272

and what arts did he use to separate them: 7.935120352781785

she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present: 8.829367012276322

i have certainly meant well through the whole affair: 8.39786737248158

but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much: 13.30584603002328

you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general: 9.409281381236694

darcy before they had known any thing of the matter: 13.982464181964744

the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again: 9.642555132762054

i am dear sir c: 7.847723897432023

that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him: 9.845648047245572

she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh: 10.368571307870072

it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way: 8.32106271166654

they then went away: 8.740303145132224

only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage: 10.173419026004298

this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming: 11.635547811744502

bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him: 7.561044948833825

illustration a vicarage house: 6.119273708544971

the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced: 8.555600614970702

his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking: 12.112926631188301

but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design: 12.92463276726266

i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes: 7.504187817768403

no my dear i think not: 13.188246095265303

he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein: 9.744661621253035

by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st: 4.671550498821785

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement: 9.149545586538615

_we_ were always good friends and now we are better: 10.01249048911338

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs: 7.333313078477068

_ _engraved for no: 7.014069012366548

i hardly know how mr: 8.166360196792803

i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning: 8.844549557155272

it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn: 8.774695140602262

gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers: 7.517762757342654

i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr: 11.305600855328272

yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation: 8.199584554501858

after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men: 8.631714404405875

wickham who left the place immediately and mrs: 9.177744073563948

indeed jane you ought to believe me: 10.711890292614456

you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound: 10.055865491209767

you are quite right: 9.002242906095006

bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr: 7.567205668770997

the gentlemen did approach and when mr: 7.524042442997181

if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable: 8.961020783349586

hurst s gown here she was interrupted again: 8.89339659669311

to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men: 9.811059011310396

at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life: 6.2814848440181565

while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her: 10.088432525086253

could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife: 9.853074182678373

to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart: 12.649109174495766

by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr: 8.081901790922691

are you not diverted: 11.260023388661276

be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy: 11.898123583330138

come as soon as you can on the receipt of this: 13.173258562455535

darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right: 8.721263109766834

i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him: 10.2945581936751

except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 5.84721739187691

i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him: 11.359359112653724

gracechurch street sept: 8.5029199400742

hurst and miss bingley: 6.891212524901692

gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country: 11.18355969620949

it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr: 7.49997017999635

you know my sentiments: 11.124367792569275

she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded: 8.505244776915625

can you come to morrow: 15.833766502470228

most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote: 11.594837661000444

and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did: 9.479448315779583

a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh: 11.701393854911016

philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she _did_ speak she must be vulgar: 10.083243466816954

she had very little notice from any but him: 8.394150953109847

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn: 7.997808719780981

collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much: 5.716292481484538

we were married you know at st: 10.6773383040987

bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy: 10.226460445827872

bingley her sister s being in town: 10.706444218582277

but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own: 7.914995261810671

let me be rightly understood: 6.393275414272956

i am sure there is not on _his_: 9.471594559955248

i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word: 13.83045725202551

wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be: 10.589447220075103

most willingly: 12.214568230868844

and taking her hand he would have given it to mr: 11.077266241584969

darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing: 10.049704240233414

but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt: 11.709562434497666

in future i hope we shall be always of one mind: 12.167651355740423

he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion: 9.038972529521876

a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved: 8.62885752391272

yes and i had heard it before: 13.361820227122843

and is _such_ a girl to be my nephew s sister: 11.22125250132162

i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required: 8.517068503370247

how well it sounds: 7.66261218247663

from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents: 14.299358803212291

bennet with civil self command to miss lucas: 6.551269269205582

my father bears it better: 7.2512546955466375

well well i only hope it will last: 10.866972065040834

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr: 9.48728888414265

he brought it with him for us to see: 15.1957368942702

while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them: 12.467358468383377

not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive: 8.697032900456586

i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony: 9.763852572482694

that he should have been in love with her for so many months: 12.990270179029853

how can you contrive to write so even: 7.476014899764368

have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is: 8.333831363294054

bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself: 9.619368069051397

i hope he will overlook it: 8.556319982632667

it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world: 9.26270381189404

who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust: 6.2111526821205585

when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character: 8.46013041717199

it is from my cousin mr: 9.953172607479747

as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of: 10.658692722007054

i described and enforced them earnestly: 5.44641355671922

and how impossible in others: 9.007730251440806

_i_ only want to think _you_ perfect and you set yourself against it: 8.291453888519852

she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr: 7.926979887973337

bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation: 10.248008185818444

the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen: 5.673127788356607

how you must have hated me after _that_ evening: 8.00862058094601

it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration: 10.358442855925464

every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time: 9.105890701975806

these recollections will not do at all: 12.026024095489625

my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her: 8.429504211759962

elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so: 12.394461600428523

wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr: 11.458219072787967

they had several children: 8.984334406551614

lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention: 11.677146971967677

after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family: 8.33627918399686

on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr: 9.916293017678672

but what is that to me: 12.280457612389075

he has been accused of many faults at different times but _this_ is the true one: 6.309422535600601

long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza: 13.91529788542942

i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection: 12.756906150497425

i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind: 7.104580240348229

at present i will say nothing about it: 9.095231796301519

had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister: 8.718350834596539

she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house: 11.894394977176804

when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music: 12.103194235033108

i am very very sorry: 8.216578451805882

every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away: 9.2993757255013

darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart: 10.638820087451311

they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters: 7.87820190933854

she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard: 8.913989333683242

i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way: 10.345805822479761

i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley: 9.460675150097225

when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other: 9.292510487059095

hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr: 6.7488299305880615

jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs: 8.261486159647147

they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds: 6.454159636836898

and if you will stay another _month_ complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large: 10.375644329316332

elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth: 12.299233404493506

you are quite a visit in my debt mr: 9.418870979567894

the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit: 12.139456447376936

long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips: 9.127325552931314

these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth: 7.3885764788328165

you know not what you are about: 14.541759234113075

bennet one day what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of jane s: 10.639291895133342

she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed: 10.326229289703532

but what is to be done about pemberley: 10.703929149923265

after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful: 10.672567200816898

some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr: 12.742853742406416

but gracious me: 8.771385672174796

of whom does jane ever think ill: 9.261106606663922

gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose: 8.765948085363913

how despicably have i acted: 7.73894618702848

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it: 7.499603370034658

darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow: 16.381134247730028

elizabeth had settled it that mr: 8.0227030058036

but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out: 10.317626965824347

bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses: 12.291860384270851

<NUM> a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within <NUM> days of receipt of the work: 8.003143937181425

do not you know that mr: 11.78667545269018

yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement: 10.388361504124974

what do i not owe you: 7.374819424014036

it was to be such a secret: 13.782764313310354

what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut: 11.651712465599864

collins in time: 9.306372626121798

in that case he would return no more: 11.315429409105903

i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude: 7.527233537348191

collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others: 11.610168121039296

he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear: 6.920913671307468

however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were: 12.523061141924584

the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him: 8.75067898476401

annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post: 12.402564073032874

bingley will not be detained in london by them: 10.453133613372001

at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs: 9.14479308641179

it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again: 11.763783872897603

the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr: 8.443066347057899

when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention: 14.231962758726638

bingley whose blind partiality provoked her: 5.792901257162862

it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire: 7.616385664212662

yes she will do for him very well: 13.835968506031154

she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place: 8.504823612462062

bingley and netherfield: 10.421769228255158

my dear charles what do you mean: 8.082868784852035

wickham began the subject himself: 12.440041706838002

they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought: 8.003582765925568

she plays and sings all day long: 5.246274103284604

no nothing at all: 9.197063622431962

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business: 9.251157938637562

it will save me a world of trouble and economy: 7.880644742652464

he danced only four dances: 7.409313564703879

jones says we must not think of moving her: 9.710928019527726

collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs: 10.391470333236759

then turning to mr: 7.745529623703803

i will speak to her about it myself directly: 12.477012350433496

he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while: 8.101595613772767

perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice: 12.844991419567476

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance: 8.364173089515571

did charlotte dine with you: 9.86820512518762

darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise: 8.171577301180772

for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well: 10.692587935037864

how can you be smiling so lizzy: 7.009626601555337

but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage: 13.198836065284128

i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere: 8.782388786053357

well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth: 11.75527320943232

when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room: 10.993242462169565

but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair: 8.876054319799126

his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do: 11.993718843112822

she will be married: 11.375105387202188

there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood: 8.481233279776838

that lady i suppose is your mother: 14.264893937419183

wickham has deserved much less attention from mr: 5.388832561214122

but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly: 11.238939377475004

but who was your mother: 11.472340457390821

the sight of miss lucas was odious to her: 10.41533725660062

you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert: 10.568971887781201

i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character: 7.6038571254652325

there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds: 6.3786336044940475

the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation: 8.747113389292505

but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched: 9.24125158553763

but of course she did not mention my name to you: 10.70284434842487

some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know: 10.586275304115235

till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr: 12.961017273717237

the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving: 9.255931151542189

pride prejudice: 11.567977661273561

indeed i do not dare: 13.174122207847995

her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical: 9.11379425866259

how is half such a sum to be repaid: 13.368030325649581

but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable: 10.58345445607415

though lydia s short letter to mrs: 9.169054108285088

shocking: 19.215976853608655

bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me: 10.938415465795828

she felt anew the justice of mr: 5.81669013265388

what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt: 10.947067190749113

i should like it beyond any thing: 7.858908452320505

collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself: 9.656229244407214

he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday: 10.569578254403758

wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs: 8.905615371823478

gardiner could not but be deeply affected: 8.01700766370542

where shall you change horses: 7.898074741304912

i am always glad to get a young person well placed out: 8.352390160051685

i send no compliments to your mother: 8.366362544946417

how i laughed: 9.34757989302525

i hope not so: 10.528996573092607

at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family: 9.67974137784572

what think you of books: 9.938709992287839

what does he say: 9.326940428713081

darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr: 6.936862429059977

and poor mr: 8.362441243605415

philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade: 10.940095838008482

there is a lady it seems a mrs: 9.358318475806986

<NUM> and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder: 8.405940805370943

bingley followed his advice: 8.099661050848184

it would be dreadful: 9.713094807644215

though i thought it would be very good fun if i was: 14.569241718590659

long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise: 13.540472404226156

in another minute mr: 7.0188976211178025

it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain: 9.799029473951233

we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth: 9.284550680108948

it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side: 5.921442571000971

the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr: 6.943503878958195

whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr: 8.71876258030867

but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment: 7.951718570996805

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character: 11.470102037364647

my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to: 10.146863720252703

darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her: 13.239755559630161

his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr: 7.889676290947202

i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object: 9.77724363336066

it is impossible for _me_ to be impartial: 11.716769246946344

bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine: 13.50354956961681

is _her_ husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother: 12.292289075841532

darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her: 7.405256952792535

one seems so forlorn without them: 5.704157221227541

the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification: 6.258217757274631

added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune: 10.894430091157343

when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish: 11.517255160508478

but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it: 12.5476332948084

all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation: 9.593804086869675

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs: 8.522911496957052

can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this: 7.975685513190018

darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning: 12.495497854899503

end of the second volume: 15.285331582173788

hang kitty: 10.563692486141319

and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him: 10.104955421384071

your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you: 7.26289062708414

he _was_ coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey: 8.067791794686068

painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled: 7.151853868991859

he still loves me and we are engaged: 10.083261878843928

collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater: 9.221275437921356

i must ask whether you were surprised: 9.978791550093296

i am not now to learn replied mr: 6.603919168095123

well my dear said mr: 8.523837756445708

the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of: 8.622311352117903

philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces: 10.55818101348477

perhaps there was some truth in _this_ though i doubt whether _his_ reserve or _anybody s_ reserve can be answerable for the event: 7.663318677411741

four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival: 9.85947421050885

that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before: 14.9227567362177

they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain: 9.85042267458188

if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy: 8.385817876215455

when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again: 11.831558551985244

she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it: 11.543363771405048

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it: 10.682142122006894

i cannot think so very ill of wickham: 10.54687687158721

well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done: 10.350072033619194

collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs: 7.892101741052647

my dear sir replied mr: 6.397571503650821

they were excessively sorry to go: 9.828332989386679

bingley i am sure: 9.621330307185648

the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable: 9.55638715190394

it was mr: 8.099266559177027

the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me: 11.0487065852388

her heart did whisper that he had done it for her: 11.064962203705166

i never thought mr: 7.205849714211088

i am so happy: 7.162035152615011

elizabeth s courage did not fail her: 9.804546120370357

but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present: 11.666695797097336

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in: 7.721856322059837

my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street: 9.965222810220729

but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished: 10.528244408086236

but does lydia know nothing of this: 8.643194008481315

such were the gentle murmurs of mrs: 6.240230653557283

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection: 6.292284536710507

i do think mrs: 7.05220419561363

to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone: 6.3878996646802015

scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings: 12.909762932043778

on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all: 7.243837704282082

their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself: 12.164148693962941

you are over scrupulous surely: 6.593568111618836

iii: 16.517683214156893

while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr: 8.216541587780902

bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr: 8.522626665658024

her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it: 8.955612898700398

yes to the last: 16.359533380306267

what could he mean: 11.441098020455321

it is _not_ mr: 7.308246886095078

i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy: 8.151858911804538

he readily agreed to it: 8.876689449028756

bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income: 6.365584033650249

collins first came to hunsford: 10.528008766974054

i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better: 9.73652288468017

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them: 9.990070710239245

young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life: 6.994297498526711

i knew that mr: 6.629083263040065

when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs: 6.818109680428245

i think you said she was a widow sir: 12.05298467949542

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all <NUM> states of the united states: 6.159705458297928

they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs: 8.922992023476754

if _i_ can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too: 9.178848123879053

darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs: 9.333133504903326

here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country: 9.293967225837577

my poor father: 10.73028745953819

the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles: 7.8705997945243915

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry: 11.322125706179326

professor michael s: 7.689651186131626

he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy: 11.650290098514024

this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr: 8.55331022029356

gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world: 10.708113278899663

jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me: 9.926054863660193

darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day: 7.773208651249911

my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned: 8.877772059883133

that he has neither integrity nor honour: 9.667628169948824

you are severe on us: 8.215553124808567

i had not thought mr: 8.267137930666694

there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton: 10.54300956085778

philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards: 7.129818409387026

i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings: 9.846660062801178

she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress: 7.45969793384044

i only hope they may have half my good luck: 8.731981772185256

darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer: 8.713234331322642

but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me: 5.554626747792199

whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy: 10.304151279530831

her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you: 6.915378091770424

collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure: 11.148110789467296

darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party: 7.26855036976955

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed: 10.102431235886982

i congratulate her: 9.43738659333252

her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates: 12.979877221184772

i never was: 9.471933707294493

if indeed it should be so: 12.240458160940968

elizabeth smiled: 11.1702752536434

additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work: 9.297566276461026

she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name: 9.848148030685447

her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms: 8.87489055765165

she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side: 9.663273246493393

so tall: 12.762873960639231

they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects: 9.898473024918454

lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr: 9.593725158085107

i am trying to make it out: 9.316196962882984

we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb: 8.59083272655587

we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome: 7.265876029104645

collins s scruples of leaving mr: 5.722699473415725

do not you want to know who has taken it: 12.467132745969195

but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together: 8.711470875532994

elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her: 7.463658580277179

with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand: 7.409995849316127

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs: 7.198895017629745

there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well: 7.487656373509873

to know that her daughter would be married was enough: 16.643169988605997

he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr: 8.160452599696088

to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female: 8.015823748983511

now is your time: 14.072165229937264

mamma would like to go too of all things: 11.15289092977955

philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs: 7.225746980319949

elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr: 8.36212906965176

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand: 9.63906526819467

laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion: 12.608240372134388

gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own: 10.713627290938327

<NUM> or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs <NUM>: 8.088346113117828

but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr: 8.633946509356155

yes but he seemed to like his second better: 11.39419497282854

but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations: 4.561302783842895

they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs: 8.75079690756274

only think: 13.203095311398712

cried he: 11.855183761450615

gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject: 9.351400354840637

in talking over their route the evening before mrs: 8.30576994040958

nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight: 6.020814926904335

she had ventured only one glance at darcy: 8.100368992102945

a short pause followed this speech and mrs: 7.337085243093771

sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with: 11.40838451608675

this will never do: 12.782410137367346

gardiner abused her stupidity: 6.426154166350397

were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion: 10.114013748671685

i do not mind his not talking to mrs: 6.799130102831394

illustration morning dress: 7.755099836702849

you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged: 9.403632461022006

had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family: 10.88974109153504

but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away: 10.169515491615421

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs: 11.15794483681117

the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person: 10.628223551356376

i _did_ hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly: 10.000350901494265

i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner: 12.512635345226673

the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances: 9.147105507802141

she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind: 7.711718751398945

yes i call it a _very_ easy distance: 7.42862617115855

the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak: 8.797312462840663

multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets example m rs: 3.596959085850398

no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard: 6.211127349017548

my good opinion once lost is lost for ever: 6.409123813963125

she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters: 9.501462491217216

bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for _her_ and live to see her take my place in it: 10.005277211111103

this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least: 9.455559978935137

collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings: 7.3498955509775294

if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me: 11.35163480459623

widely different was the effect of a second perusal: 13.437602993591714

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country: 10.967888420062026

thank you but i always mend my own: 11.744424339087539

my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine: 9.234401189770557

perfectly so i thank you: 10.239701573617356

you do not look well: 10.999524042780786

elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying: 10.08680721011732

elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough: 8.304499234363009

what could be the meaning of it: 9.692138751402108

all this was acknowledged to mrs: 10.459902712450475

cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came: 8.690350998956568

upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward: 8.33493576914461

when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister: 10.26384138995669

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could: 10.518063048238071

and then when we came away it was such fun: 12.035144825230471

bingley is most unaffectedly modest: 6.597068035047058

but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit: 9.05119844615637

i will try again: 7.7979387127929725

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr: 7.917244498964967

the children have been wanting me this half hour: 8.500305598196817

removed: 20.29447944900828

his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure: 8.97172895946705

wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed: 10.361931741360381

elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile: 7.358609623212436

in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society: 7.707279766311913

but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could: 8.87971722350264

i will put on my things in a moment: 9.7656607912026

his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment: 9.015318652863888

he does not want abilities: 9.48981745670968

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr: 8.472522823549143

as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables: 8.957247302674608

a great deal more passed at the other table: 11.07713476562317

will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him: 11.971161009055226

do not think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ side: 10.014431849415868

she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months: 10.73984571862337

give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey: 9.022612168792529

hill and the two housemaids: 14.795457110089632

she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet: 11.554068895192152

her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice: 5.280456923090034

perhaps i am not doing her justice: 10.409368966448326

are the others coming out: 12.25133144237185

the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did: 12.621449442665302

from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him: 11.313488241313177

his surprise was great: 10.925027300179973

lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable: 8.441492237748747

there can be no doubt of that: 12.569553128889709

both sisters were uncomfortable enough: 9.633200115558239

i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother: 10.836464648772289

accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer: 9.419764969229508

though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour: 8.317025911505459

and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty: 10.201449972323346

brother in law of wickham: 10.70826986041755

they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone: 8.223501564452238

i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night: 3.9922199573320216

it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present: 9.83059719537275

and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away: 10.947111456273596

what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer: 9.535801575528952

she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable: 9.320571562829752

but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me: 9.296550334451814

bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr: 11.195457586380469

sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before: 7.7490455545723

let me never see either one or the other again: 10.601799835053848

this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he: 10.166230594146787

but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it: 8.715901816805486

bingley to _her_: 9.482217842621845

they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible: 7.0583693870779785

lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over: 9.154374891990976

elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect: 7.369494400781109

you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends: 11.738034917074271

she now lost every expectation of pleasure: 8.782761178653356

it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner: 10.557594192837133

bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion: 10.119063820728043

bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was: 6.569388049158299

let me hear what it is: 10.499751857786919

he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it: 7.437332764939267

what would she have said: 11.491255203912033

young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer: 8.405026035200962

forster and me are _such_ friends: 7.550953613341206

she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty: 9.794751686317959

lydia my love ring the bell: 8.096350970853972

bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his: 12.565472354876112

gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both: 6.676848704015178

how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow: 12.734216337048796

darcy s eyes were fixed on her: 8.253176427530637

bennet s eyes sparkled: 7.358888929739302

you appear to me mr: 11.144860470275745

the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage: 8.170280611622124

darcy she could not but allow that mr: 7.863650479945999

the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country: 9.852707069430378

a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite: 6.843068493016724

do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley: 8.062030878426093

i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing: 10.229778582928457

i dare say the lace upon mrs: 5.0855488740214145

he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence: 10.549255351934669

collins s admiration: 8.196603778519895

it is of no consequence: 9.080787991273029

the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid: 6.947685667576262

i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle: 12.466340630910862

i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception: 9.528606171650624

i had not an idea of it: 11.662186641795111

he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again: 9.35563183858729

jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day: 10.706806969812202

what news: 13.292240460948324

collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could: 8.011205092853912

tis an etiquette i despise said he: 6.233371770588823

what can have induced him to behave so cruelly: 8.414765874482487

you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr: 9.573867574007554

the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful: 14.205885885294439

they agreed that mrs: 7.572865139221656

he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names: 4.970290839787573

elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr: 9.874775182646847

catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london: 9.922954327373578

it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express: 13.064655119297365

there is something very pompous in his style: 9.996165108708471

they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs: 9.663838395755324

good god: 12.095597178494309

she is my youngest girl but one: 9.764095052595293

the rector of a parish has much to do: 10.438691090496723

he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably: 6.455057113713388

i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance: 12.228735408800542

they insist also on my seeing mr: 6.913029779971659

she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation: 7.254625206682739

collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer: 8.785120420411367

i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world: 10.251690724481437

if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far: 9.117327532990243

gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire: 8.529817018510416

it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like: 7.648726166454442

the next day opened a new scene at longbourn: 7.521692603571867

she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him: 12.048658106034067

he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone: 8.523791274044243

bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months: 7.374957637644066

when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion: 7.922784167451666

cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted: 10.558017878078617

darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr: 11.481191826373026

but we considered it we talked of it as impossible: 10.124498440295461

she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr: 10.49495002720316

impossible mr: 10.797077479824033

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation: 7.894274422366083

<NUM> or <NUM>: 7.568698643182469

at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave: 8.511967094713773

not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you: 9.77021046249172

with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted: 10.12056295988506

here you are in your own family: 15.933536311575018

but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet: 8.722569459848419

that he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr: 7.625484056732298

lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed: 10.48930711431318

and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there: 8.422128985843047

you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer: 8.588673086953158

you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice: 11.506497224334758

i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer: 6.544547132882895

bennet cried his wife what are you talking of: 8.938943711790877

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it: 13.808978692864715

in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger: 9.853960018577988

collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason: 8.531139821459494

your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr: 9.076736240486156

it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure: 9.94176492724655

ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it: 11.832388088692076

darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least: 8.90151591817841

you have said quite enough madam: 9.057620282469356

darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling: 10.470823178354632

my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it: 11.061331954413568

she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her: 7.6563118282314155

i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter: 8.756090892586874

what has she frightened away some of your lovers: 10.755165503506607

a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility: 9.2107266543108

while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes: 7.098165254511344

and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh: 8.025168882435425

the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose: 8.891864764951713

both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds: 11.83208730017304

to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible: 9.512127728929547

it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know: 10.5783235654544

it is a nice long walk and mr: 6.6724186499713944

end of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice this file should be named <NUM> <NUM>: 7.029275767404337

the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question: 10.451528125976965

bennet as he folded up the letter: 10.76184323158577

but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable: 12.723609359791775

bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday: 11.053710193088245

it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours: 7.984155826955729

as soon as jane had read mr: 9.666906360736599

elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month: 12.37161773473185

though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not: 10.32171759404611

indeed i had: 15.464422491953812

believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections: 8.003294467915488

three daughters married: 11.879367441472098

but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company: 7.596424329585845

i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance: 8.104475072072635

collins so before you came: 9.750014551281954

there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way: 11.329370849267589

bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon: 7.7175996011665635

but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world: 7.540995280858199

there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much: 8.618925227008596

elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr: 7.987756528437887

they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment: 8.238855877096015

last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary: 11.399923224395083

dear lizzy: 13.04874506784469

this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself: 8.882890227137752

darcy said very little and mr: 9.124302555257872

others of the party were now applied to: 15.117377114884631

but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read: 9.37755092042213

what could be more natural than his asking you again: 9.429890424649352

but i know the foundation is unjust: 10.515661722024708

they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr: 9.86134948058321

chapter xxii: 8.950968636090755

i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it: 11.422905859333543

she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr: 4.8561059749883935

and with a low bow he left her to attack mr: 9.836444659998895

now what have you to say: 13.99154013726083

are you going much farther: 7.900453953191386

but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model: 10.42014457349196

he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire: 14.506760816869384

he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent: 8.384522856914232

whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to _you_: 13.233687595434947

or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others: 6.225715465277765

do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart: 8.831314774539274

it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best: 8.857280860217333

elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr: 8.275310390428182

no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself: 7.826208019156498

they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight: 5.7591482300737304

i believe madam i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him: 6.52365586690304

wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself: 6.809023366071694

as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery: 9.377226011320005

darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year: 8.443816801361931

bennet you will wait on him of course: 13.356399258840087

if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least: 7.982761402225489

yes certainly: 11.037890153979157

it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match: 11.003235112313686

she added by far too much: 8.335697292381798

how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book: 9.566445521023029

he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday: 8.057174766737706

the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation: 7.603108896037648

you must send john with the young ladies mrs: 9.251514156382948

bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth: 8.998593319564591

hurst began again: 8.076355078410833

nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled: 10.707279517333328

darcy just deigned to return: 8.054278266967197

wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball: 9.229920914870172

lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure: 11.579449104086482

it was very little less: 10.828221083056047

you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty: 9.590462358794761

bingley and under your orders: 7.445457582054607

i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life: 10.36158102394666

but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr: 10.687439482396194

we have heard nothing from town: 9.125693695773633

the visit was returned in due form: 7.028305661270789

how i long to see her: 8.540182619661831

bingley will like it lizzy: 9.03914224660942

i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen: 12.352143930319132

the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments: 6.764348134522572

collins and lizzy: 8.652488942290585

but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr: 7.17930663582099

but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood: 8.786852840667539

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr: 8.59697798022929

lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself: 5.743117128981196

if i could but see _you_ as happy: 9.229113583114078

when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr: 9.13128644968113

as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it: 7.462548772722892

she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side: 8.861692102225481

w: 13.110144761836318

but i think mr: 9.79830370161169

the day passed much as the day before had done: 14.508339042531595

where is your sister: 12.349917831230462

we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her: 8.5100909050121

oh brother how kind you are: 7.842835456372795

her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire: 8.482073041248675

bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from: 9.223014465271046

he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask: 10.802666707141706

bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent: 8.371741056343264

till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose _him_: 9.627032445339946

wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet: 9.998808343575574

elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend: 6.755996531363033

what a contrast between him and his friend: 9.3214661244625

why was he to be the judge: 12.031220279866217

his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go: 10.550696587329487

elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ the worth of each was eclipsed by mr: 10.448588379866136

bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together: 7.896996641974323

a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr: 8.735543005411076

at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing: 11.148688153655314

to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good: 11.007585314585237

his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature: 9.080734226987097

_she_ blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour: 7.192419398399953

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away: 10.020767367843204

said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it: 11.223229437101521

she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged mr: 7.9063872320459465

elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it: 6.650962105096006

certainly: 18.219554372358456

and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose: 11.156008091612078

the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr: 13.71166809708657

i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after: 10.80298256114547

is not there a little mistake: 14.301453210627171

gregory b: 9.28678302770954

he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley: 11.595081744951806

what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here: 7.890781266288834

you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you: 9.27433716621174

she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr: 9.805657803696535

jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening: 8.883650261232368

lady catherine s great attentions to mrs: 6.8033694060926475

but perhaps mr: 8.221320595751301

bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf: 7.020617199241911

darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs: 7.7334371971755305

elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion: 8.059124302867108

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful: 12.711849273242775

as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen: 5.867951851474528

lady catherine seemed resigned: 7.367699747340544

hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker: 9.153096614742552

this is an evening of wonders indeed: 8.198506944814431

illustration matlock pride and prejudice a novel: 5.313403465230747

so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible: 11.633872605089346

he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger: 14.775094350373314

darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner: 11.498735808674988

elizabeth looked surprised: 9.987436670950743

if _you_ have not been mistaken here _i_ must have been in an error: 10.291972563926334

it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling: 6.614165387082659

but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design: 7.157827450938442

my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not: 9.682297343239965

unless a copyright notice is included: 6.5579181370001445

he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life: 11.119520834381698

eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds: 9.705329225598529

but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art: 10.108380699296077

he was received by mrs: 9.094506087927881

your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr: 10.811832947700841

mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected: 8.147244489135703

the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away: 9.852671377872918

his misfortunes: 14.08566612612358

darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on _fine eyes_: 7.504363233444315

you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin: 9.810371036150958

how merry we shall be together when we meet: 9.37268754072991

their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room: 11.826292738042833

jane looked at her doubtingly: 9.417207081755947

i am not equal to it: 8.785802610743918

you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared: 11.100227338824457

i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable: 6.9106534096471

you do not blame me however for refusing him: 7.366689624322835

the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance: 9.4372132193189

_mr: 16.517768732311186

unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds: 8.376141276660118

you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did: 7.234199279939175

he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty: 7.259531263540546

the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks: 10.314009227435053

elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others: 7.619999381156716

but really madam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early: 9.580811908872983

his temptation is not adequate to the risk: 12.833616567538414

collins s joints of meat were too large for her family: 5.985566183198745

i expected to find a more reasonable young woman: 10.358033885771217

i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement: 10.975728231353251

i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again: 10.388204022663118

bingley _i_ always keep servants that can do their own work _my_ daughters are brought up differently: 5.95988613196084

and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it: 9.269331873796945

darcy bowed: 10.502496064254618

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend: 7.631336438620553

she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine: 11.171655542309365

she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice: 11.194503807515797

in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger: 9.415524067672209

my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed: 6.5691196365400915

gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s: 8.953248085438442

bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate: 11.534791968209955

her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming: 12.4014685503186

who would have thought it: 13.092650780701664

every thing nourishes what is strong already: 9.284577927458662

bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last: 8.610004166114576

jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness: 12.466741298871623

if it was not for the entail i should not mind it: 14.262580824225148

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family: 8.08819954835156

though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr: 12.125989075629596

the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this: 10.35495178761047

such a countenance such manners: 10.94204617339897

about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr: 8.90260175646866

bennet protested against any description of finery: 6.278004253539321

miss bingley was engrossed by mr: 7.170983266832493

he was angry: 12.770622405387869

bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together: 9.3272959108876

_invented by m rs bell <NUM> charlotte street bedford square: 3.8849679766373324

darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr: 8.869879875101237

for my part mr: 9.514410644235591

the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr: 11.945258544829311

after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr: 6.563872270496267

the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr: 5.42962170607825

there mrs: 10.157422461361136

reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time: 12.062536084355354

philips and _she_ ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton: 9.595369702654812

bennet i am quite delighted with him: 9.696591762753217

chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_ let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way: 6.713035653976714

about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention: 8.644563808191114

charlotte herself was tolerably composed: 8.458855653223846

bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign: 8.14522914106861

darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting: 12.214523039340767

you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves: 9.091066272074533

it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland: 8.071554425974915

collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases: 10.149987239250915

but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents: 11.085397971340086

his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind: 16.47222517520107

collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home: 8.746140979548878

collins too: 10.518780358361449

soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were: 11.13883966835776

to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either: 9.787331051046149

never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings: 8.449184916288624

bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding: 8.239381408145421

she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you: 9.61753921736421

i desire you will stay where you are: 9.273608874319216

and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace: 6.204413292899784

the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above: 13.244525861521277

very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business: 10.40004123286748

would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again: 9.699778704273

be assured my dear sir that mrs: 9.969509716349814

he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child: 6.965829087555423

when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr: 10.87967383168328

there was no arguing upon such a project: 10.587543731605427

darcy and mr: 7.153264475387201

you cannot be too much on your guard: 10.30490891352303

i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man: 6.93533513636161

to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther: 9.861566963266004

if i have i shall be the last person to confess it: 13.650771427485926

after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt: 7.473069161216067

darcy could have such boundless influence: 9.224374456285931

gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her: 8.45409905312773

reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister: 8.657637065175418

it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations: 10.569067027698258

it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before: 13.35397317185833

i cannot think of it without abhorrence: 11.699784302171436

it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor: 9.800487562286028

he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions: 10.526719231208274

indeed you are mistaken: 11.864171110609261

my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me: 11.678151444998672

they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs: 6.475023978817752

you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him: 6.918188954017834

darcy contradict it: 7.852388632399861

darcy they had only seen at church: 10.758382506264217

she had gained her point and had time to consider of it: 8.677413012857604

she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition: 7.512420087794675

i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse: 7.171164238749553

bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband: 9.77060647399179

i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy: 13.26778899100961

in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin: 9.127827818608997

but while he was mortal there must be a triumph: 10.981507099856877

we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care: 8.900697735046975

darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation: 12.93734423258548

supposing him to be attached to me would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin: 10.64230852943143

you must come and make lizzy marry mr: 7.70651504477274

bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them: 9.067281204962345

i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think: 10.143218363303244

the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious: 10.944709636774228

you ought all to have learned: 14.108905538930145

and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married: 9.450864045329169

tis as good as a lord: 11.276929667525922

i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help: 8.308065414215225

and mary king is safe: 8.449115259878896

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject: 11.071978712263155

she is quite a little creature: 13.74367540438668

the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr: 10.976539692124739

said charlotte as soon as he was gone: 13.475283126852728

cried his wife impatiently: 10.344847568001027

bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required: 9.050597392888868

he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them: 8.347161284003878

she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung: 10.994065138482897

it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane: 8.621008955506722

that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does _not_ write with ease: 10.388568428781005

bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof: 8.47929501759621

bingley arrived: 11.69003590437166

in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton: 8.109601924371145

i cannot do justice to his kindness: 9.28724016080479

wickham so very bad: 12.250934443301263

and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs: 12.255711351069731

the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs: 6.786114052317427

has she been presented: 10.937507142086742

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet: 8.405117474757724

the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting: 7.275320059035483

he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him: 11.768315388114107

gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power: 8.06252984132055

his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure: 7.008620904192791

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting: 9.612206850280376

i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason: 9.965480320862518

it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction: 7.707750513759693

collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility: 9.203137430573939

bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion _his_ mind was not very differently engaged: 10.65535480805057

and what do you think she said besides: 11.732877476318665

pray what is your age: 11.353552075853228

dear yes but you must own she is very plain: 13.929294596656813

but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time: 8.34080109556718

a little sea bathing would set me up for ever: 5.924586674303129

robert william chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever: 4.864701269822318

nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation: 11.540453986936924

the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study: 8.31037306714537

bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner: 10.875095542111428

the promised letter of thanks from mr: 6.021693135670584

you are not going to introduce yourself to mr: 8.411253629816589

darcy a most intimate confidential friend: 7.575285242202623

my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology: 7.9521405331758315

that _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head: 11.356055085801737

have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference: 11.080080331053043

bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs: 5.784695350187128

on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book: 9.972835765720015

you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them: 13.17536640297852

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine: 11.848328623699619

till this moment i never knew myself: 11.250306497970255

he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all: 13.633218050622002

thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room: 8.391160144822434

it is a long time mr: 8.350382520571987

my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal: 15.236397831179774

elizabeth was now to see mr: 10.630224140368933

she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success: 9.374116333252799

bennet and prepared for backgammon: 6.893948878158401

i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies: 9.162096738857032

away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech: 10.156453963264356

the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment: 11.106062080703856

she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother: 12.990086881815778

darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer: 7.3789909676429986

it was kindly meant: 8.485787997247916

if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family _this_ would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her: 9.479470298125136

a carat character is used to denote superscription: 6.061295554064205

it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her: 7.78311283023094

two days after mr: 8.755150015900833

the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits: 9.006293734848233

in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation: 10.698411500543518

consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr: 10.208224977740409

bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage: 13.328949271801212

not a soul knew of it but col: 11.486449360231465

you could not make _me_ happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so: 11.385404353343153

how hard it is in some cases to be believed: 14.073888782154235

nobody can tell what i suffer: 12.617356000458456

he was silent: 9.70646357612427

it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago: 10.641676745827686

next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then: 12.55792403221498

_you_ observed it mr: 6.831042461480851

it was generally evident whenever they met that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent: 12.232928626143703

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn: 9.00837490639385

mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how: 10.549076635206042

hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am: 8.143642623304173

she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success: 11.54126434053278

your examination of mr: 6.204273086707512

but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him: 10.965165189338002

on finding mrs: 9.21017615907163

her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day: 10.72910651925416

her aunt now called her to look at a picture: 12.671169745126907

the possibility of meeting mr: 7.839687620756826

i should be sorry indeed if it were: 8.530928555613228

bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning: 6.449628282307703

kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy: 8.926039985680218

i am not romantic you know: 6.520655997596286

why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear: 9.977301861136423

when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr: 9.883247184822661

her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room: 9.43191360471256

when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit: 8.80699507366711

bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son: 9.65400568686438

no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy: 5.846830235980233

elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley: 10.747647358624056

we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s: 9.95514911354179

bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house: 8.45859705831245

darcy danced only once with mrs: 7.094983920615296

they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others: 8.18541052430798

wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable: 10.838656723926047

a lively imagination soon settled it all: 8.1930462395031

the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention: 7.36404702851034

what none of you: 12.648847134882677

bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters: 8.508239142655947

miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy: 11.98582139011617

she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley: 10.31569228098799

she stared coloured doubted and was silent: 8.050903157051142

wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows: 7.018018343809337

bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner: 9.004123135035421

but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london: 11.59273743969847

we want none of them do we: 9.919630966776438

at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting: 11.139682131714894

they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens: 8.398480708590698

and have you heard from him often: 12.851774756373649

it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of: 9.379173039152047

i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself: 10.395910265015566

the loo table however did not appear: 9.145509582891819

bingley might like you the best of the party: 11.277010391185287

i must speak to hill this moment: 8.22182291471794

very true and if i had my will we should: 11.337094642060386

as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown: 10.724917100457057

it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour: 11.197139382759257

collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character: 10.600929935412468

but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else: 8.751178967731096

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs: 11.236210509936532

with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic: 9.290947281717086

its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned: 4.857030904198162

attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham: 6.801431411564197

there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire: 7.15882075481067

as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more: 6.091778469343555

to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own: 8.876194451321192

of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt: 19.35885570808652

this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth: 8.809051415561422

and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself: 9.120711626575664

she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her: 8.878752487467082

you refuse then to oblige me: 7.303949652772852

if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this: 9.100427058667368

bingley returned mr: 7.762741751058251

how shall we punish him for such a speech: 9.915605812839969

i beg you will not go: 10.909808841920603

yes she will remain there till christmas: 7.288943230256478

she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly: 9.045077795718326

i am sick of mr: 5.80931818051679

who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual: 7.303223387998946

the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago: 9.248449015028301

philips first brought her the news: 9.63240942994527

little more than half a day s journey: 11.976712831991932

of mr: 10.099725205278082

his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr: 9.540735635043402

she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes: 8.684514393671316

to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr: 7.089048883176746

they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long: 9.19389178280132

bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as mr: 9.501189709289381

her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it: 7.618316798502799

yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of: 8.953881166071703

darcy afterwards discharged: 8.183857804506111

she looks sickly and cross: 6.765000253995808

collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received: 11.342054874658075

collins well: 10.254387647818158

i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think: 6.991825966965823

what hours of transport we shall spend: 8.614202671882945

had she merely _dined_ with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal: 8.339206613709617

she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage: 8.82755749364706

this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married: 10.750196890146087

annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs: 7.949312714860859

almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life: 10.899166723975368

i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back: 10.954040442096874

in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it: 12.261768639560767

she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished: 6.717803223797009

generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself: 9.578583056943723

and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon: 11.579717570564643

i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns: 8.277047598145064

long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr: 9.906331196238153

my dear father she cried come back and write immediately: 8.151513299650547

thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women: 8.021817074418522

reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections: 9.766009718993162

speak to lizzy about it yourself: 13.069685873712414

bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy: 12.721849679527628

very much: 16.033921784290275

on the following monday mrs: 9.203207285271095

collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered: 7.2082269490235715

the idea of mr: 8.262954271967793

remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do: 13.223024618802814

bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning: 10.241223961245364

that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations: 10.046673711652403

he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs: 7.846784428541562

you blamed me for coming: 9.104025364231918

do you certainly leave kent on saturday: 8.076767658546455

bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough: 8.044641913783158

she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld: 8.942797444258867

i now give it to _you_ if you are resolved on having him: 12.24252393308818

thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business: 10.305568454148428

she knew not what to think nor how to account for it: 8.916123406946348

it is unaccountable: 7.796634851793596

there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others: 10.145179340380162

collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands: 11.19292653363882

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness: 9.241073655235542

wickham too: 11.10077472880644

her own thoughts were employing her: 9.038263236942383

_they_ will never be distressed for money: 8.769433689232745

i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time: 9.285997265278056

oh sister: 10.522806113947405

you have sense and we all expect you to use it: 10.987597631349516

at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance: 8.75042726128436

no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame: 10.986760914283158

bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr: 8.303138097863435

so do not put yourself to inconvenience: 12.118590195267567

nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law: 8.351605203451683

if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg tm electronic works in your possession: 6.153060349041449

do any thing rather than marry without affection: 9.206153355345512

collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge: 9.072226796466024

darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence: 5.712292017161166

he came to tell mr: 10.590076223503393

i cannot make him out: 11.175521605812307

i am most seriously displeased: 6.259517654297409

the church _ought_ to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now: 10.776387054934151

but it is so strange: 10.51592366831127

collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road: 9.719952237923405

but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked: 9.109644407403682

kitty owned that she had rather stay at home: 10.834152076156013

he had been some time with mr: 10.085404406190372

in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself: 6.787052383557339

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr: 7.595194639345145

you have a house in town i conclude: 11.505993023124232

the general prejudice against mr: 8.172381305118211

sir i do indeed: 16.77559692559096

an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family: 11.286632062439297

she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs: 4.81773214390653

and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son: 9.199684439593828

but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference: 8.887616421436157

what are we to do: 8.989801199769582

the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first: 9.719010611951363

collins and i will never see you again if you _do_: 12.101588414240858

i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished: 8.621503233390792

a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected: 10.817042849004713

bingley were at piquet and mrs: 6.578124027498396

cried bingley: 12.777333662034595

wretched wretched mistake: 8.887823154018289

if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair: 9.510504603865387

i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter: 9.115170744300135

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible: 9.857012905745563

yes madam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor: 13.10322098284032

but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here: 12.17914291307666

elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation: 9.384002109490286

there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed: 7.998080038443321

but your _family_ owe me nothing: 5.52298236774836

my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now: 10.089926392248065

this is a wretched beginning indeed: 8.721158433603588

my fingers wait your orders: 6.137307631655962

they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression: 10.251283524968976

elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them: 9.483839252065277

but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country: 7.890289957407571

the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed: 11.833739783772105

for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him: 13.646348662495956

darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs: 7.964045457527666

i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield: 11.2284390076778

jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes: 8.697395300834948

does your charge give you much trouble: 9.572178862874512

it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham: 9.391284860475414

but you are not entitled to know _mine_ nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit: 9.212697160264078

is that his design in settling here: 11.179839093595751

forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs: 13.495729291615415

is this thought elizabeth meant for me: 8.585580679100023

philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room: 9.08666850094418

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected: 9.790160823721866

to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected: 9.22866120527331

such an openness and gentleness in his manner: 9.96098696510339

it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr: 9.804326504466735

and it was not wholly without foundation: 10.372866164225599

after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f: 6.716646839202204

the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each: 9.990153710292772

however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham: 11.09396325597997

i am sorry to pain you but so it was: 8.893801313828138

bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar: 11.271712781765432

gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland: 8.579174905652948

bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down: 9.060990819943626

as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park: 9.0391702709381

my uncle: 10.91101145496929

yes all of them i think: 14.113555364756403

darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile: 11.833775522671049

your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings: 10.721795448393003

she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr: 5.77308022976562

you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg tm works: 6.7611698740152075

except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate: 9.408452705560238

lady catherine i have nothing farther to say: 9.881253672518737

we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way: 9.7550359136878

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence: 8.765401127159842

twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too: 8.825577451401758

but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year: 10.903532768460929

but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy: 8.523578359821697

i write rather slowly: 7.689396545884429

as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither: 10.957140653602485

he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend: 11.62884063711013

when you told mrs: 8.531813853496459

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr: 9.866700714469268

darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr: 11.638772080166147

but she would not be secure: 14.049120367337391

gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation: 9.865423482601155

and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house: 9.203257633255246

darcy s looks and behaviour: 7.40798751843563

why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight: 8.598118950982244

bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied: 8.137370336322432

there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town: 9.990764044158611

would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe: 8.55034802561724

hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her: 7.0337783939614384

yes if darcy does not put it off again: 8.92168005260124

tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day: 7.982847763522709

adieu: 18.19425135582459

at present i have not room to do them justice: 11.949583786987356

elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr: 6.5873962190697055

you promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him: 8.234756031242604

i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately: 9.477760804130583

how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner: 11.237617554017131

and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well: 6.62970535869834

i am ashamed of you: 10.012638167353963

i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary: 11.396462019965242

but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult: 12.940754457201074

poor reynolds she was always very fond of me: 10.859444494836579

i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character: 7.009066010060384

he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister: 6.475533537286283

i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this: 11.178525905581326

if i said mr: 8.56384431160432

no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did: 11.118797005483247

but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane: 12.511974074611873

bingley s friend without being heard by either of them: 8.253306103514095

if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach: 7.8112586736555505

do you then pretend to be ignorant of it: 10.808473037399823

i am quite well: 7.321051163151045

dear me: 10.60785796321777

sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion: 8.72879073938588

and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy: 11.880040411482767

your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner: 8.117391681526476

information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit <NUM> c <NUM> educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service: 4.872898735288887

i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter: 10.880966697116376

_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ eliza said charlotte: 7.928825808114891

my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it: 7.768369593978412

you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice: 9.959017762614645

the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people: 6.897238684424213

i am afraid you will be angry: 8.650082255576194

for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey: 8.005361550809384

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer: 8.922199315269577

there could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr: 8.2353675256081

bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man: 9.237355093063966

the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine: 9.239590864303905

that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly: 8.497633420256296

could there be finer symptoms: 6.542224080438074

but now it was all too natural: 11.83777611442473

it is impossible that he should still love me: 8.593065030150369

now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table: 11.656004120970799

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham: 8.464471301414024

her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it: 7.755805003841439

she will make him a very proper wife: 14.382716016518133

it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs: 12.0950274067088

care of him: 14.123293207529352

unfortunately an only son for many years an only _child_ i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own: 7.296335945292597

i am sure you will be very comfortable there: 8.81441679579444

do you talk by rule then while you are dancing: 8.40915575101003

their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten: 7.1666066833725495

darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole: 9.334917550031404

it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire: 9.146803943007

collins was settled _near_ her family: 7.062382449864021

only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me: 13.280597069957016

she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it: 9.612783129667909

unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do: 9.923244145802714

dining out said mrs: 7.904488462995498

bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn: 9.075447576097087

long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself: 14.167409857966792

if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs <NUM>: 8.50176124374462

the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year: 6.960820508641815

i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire: 8.960131208111727

gracechurch street monday august <NUM>: 5.825937610174444

but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded: 9.29683810537337

_she_ will not be able to help calling: 11.534979132958673

bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments: 8.787585086584354

among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous: 12.845395965274259

nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility: 9.753632104636386

my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me: 5.973594512144412

i have sir: 9.533029728385964

darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it: 10.544108441341049

collins wants to marry lizzy: 8.566409505103229

james s had made him courteous: 7.899850641617271

it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one: 6.852379437123362

he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting: 7.476639555757321

bingley met them with hopes that mrs: 8.061402595627973

more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed: 6.944101573358929

she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses: 11.192005588514785

their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach: 9.540695839533674

bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned: 10.157464775570109

lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts: 6.655490286118444

i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister: 5.408204003778188

she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents: 9.139046055829562

and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time: 6.400280690208425

i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise: 8.466776571193252

the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes does it: 7.216771151826811

undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation: 4.8731629831444465

they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister: 8.249789322677358

_her_ mind was less difficult to develope: 8.420233759905068

and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead: 8.740268257917492

the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay: 10.719362172702976

collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness: 10.62792860107784

but how did he account for it: 8.609772830345374

a few weeks he believed: 10.25771100550631

allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged: 10.254476694432979

collins sat for some time without speaking to any body: 8.707908345210328

bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend: 8.876772472313492

i hope she will turn out well: 8.623481490118913

i cannot understand it: 8.26065455672759

darcy s steward and of _that_ i can assure you he informed me himself: 8.402092176600553

is not he a charming man: 8.870099604708974

that he should even speak to her was amazing: 11.623317016573484

let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr: 9.90046361767596

wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family: 6.700914878818283

in a doleful voice mrs: 7.410601989679486

when mrs: 9.344152395431344

caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself: 10.800169803001387

you are mistaken: 8.534448068531722

in spite of having been at st: 10.393760179057686

elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately: 8.492665066996047

i am far from attributing any part of mr: 6.405933943952838

my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request: 9.204754142218858

if i were as rich as mr: 6.0011575884446975

bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it: 11.104393181266087

bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about: 7.028137450637769

but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about: 12.213050345056825

when at length they arose to take leave mrs: 7.829875198743104

she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself: 6.520693059970018

you are so strange: 8.71557827718583

i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing: 8.020376940550596

well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle: 12.084369883064525

the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred: 8.301685571947163

bennet s best comfort was that mr: 6.331612463713615

i shall like it of all things: 12.376716495526459

elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation: 5.543553324714461

why did not you all learn: 12.804944169833536

yes thought elizabeth _that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once: 8.82103739691042

collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state: 10.655046373820737

it pains me to offend you: 8.95325947523936

colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express: 7.9828722192896775

i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family: 8.501498651935641

while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner: 8.879232499767324

is not it so mrs: 11.663120232998104

poor jane: 11.51634926634692

and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment: 12.982586321573384

we now come to the point: 14.423761253320158

he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling: 11.03601593696307

not the slightest: 16.573813269319672

i wonder what he can be doing there: 11.651581279707141

ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination: 10.26273546769765

who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him: 7.455833843711942

on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks: 8.050006767730588

bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property: 10.873011359606117

i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better: 7.5906408754636505

how can you talk so: 7.55866951219847

in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr: 8.700762189691568

cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable: 8.64199642538813

i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard: 11.256781453470587

but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted: 12.779027532339828

the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund: 5.8001793113918785

it was a subject which they could not mention before me: 10.841012407189439

bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them: 7.656924879225995

but you are always giving _her_ the preference: 9.632488296270951

his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing: 9.665504416540042

she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door: 8.753399941187078

georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved: 7.720061249565994

at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other: 10.399038943303946

she was ashamed to think how much: 11.177110828286764

his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr: 7.073818923601325

he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been: 9.7383505453868

wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister: 10.828712934359432

they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him: 8.636501157960396

my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last: 8.603959238798662

within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day: 10.739697695813106

balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters: 9.931389257922634

my dear jane: 8.863224794313423

the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work: 10.74990420829867

you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane: 10.141161798146184

you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham: 10.723965317800342

they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering: 4.860686042252598

to be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he _did_ i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr: 8.631315657214005

i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness: 10.529906547612086

she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains: 6.759279318457735

no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr: 8.831610046154836

i never heard that it was: 10.618222535833846

i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say: 6.570479479332835

darcy has not made him just to you: 10.199794618703084

in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room: 10.123115600796787

your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable: 13.253755964847429

he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling: 10.756852477716684

though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession: 8.758239659014784

wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s: 8.288235234558188

in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron: 9.724451058298914

bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr: 8.332245325552107

lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr: 7.4062289661896985

the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so: 9.664968567083866

the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence: 6.52632447291295

affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where: 4.995655782700076

but she is too much like her brother very very proud: 12.627985527383581

my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education: 8.912507143775713

i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me: 5.745652736285767

collins must excuse me: 8.186978502321562

she could think of nothing but of mr: 9.692982460181282

is this to be endured: 15.316678843847244

it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr: 10.616723877385049

and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently: 10.2153804847044

i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being: 9.24128055655495

bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests: 11.157090189146404

the first week of their return was soon gone: 11.853197302790274

i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier: 6.42419354479809

books oh: 11.112991847884256

this is quite shocking: 11.362571699315264

a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern: 13.619743072795517

the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention: 6.807427444122095

if he fears me why come hither: 6.370739703903329

lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind: 10.486963991694791

darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport: 8.423748325562276

it is just as he chooses: 11.593146348854825

with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round: 10.892165004164116

come darcy said he i must have you dance: 14.404003212069412

to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations: 7.000593261871109

she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down: 13.04008382737154

but upon my honour i do _not_: 11.522680177773072

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened: 11.819194416183354

yes there is nothing in that: 14.270685958432516

do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified: 10.015956522030228

but the clothes the wedding clothes: 7.257286863432481

your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct i am sure: 8.697323124828173

it must be an amusing study: 8.439058336358244

our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character: 8.822643142776833

gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy: 6.612668994984271

she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before: 6.770188461834887

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing: 7.698019267305262

lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless: 4.1824273798341185

a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe: 7.617969023166221

bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters: 8.669197948644339

darcy called and was shut up with him several hours: 10.906552885614687

it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire: 8.127678432418975

lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age: 8.078730324608726

and men take care that they should: 11.050416425414769

she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary: 7.144211977525383

at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs: 7.63250958564643

i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk: 7.079665229251892

i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company: 10.570498041669845

but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule: 7.285927572265874

his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else: 7.53782428739069

in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation: 7.962066727361075

did it said he did it _soon_ make you think better of me: 11.165200828272285

my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible: 10.661923267088286

neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr: 6.95414756505944

she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter: 10.726028931934403

i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve: 9.952272437678994

he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her: 10.240982697162199

if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it: 8.737363092606191

jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved: 9.856003442320837

jane shook her head: 7.622919035363234

is not general incivility the very essence of love: 8.806140964424857

have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin: 11.273576254277396

i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate: 9.22986255036597

younger sons cannot marry where they like: 6.877296970544244

at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr: 11.74700293643738

i _will_ leave him to himself: 10.437407972527765

miss bennet still looked all amazement: 7.883419268680547

this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr: 9.147490093116875

bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken: 8.003307398771048

to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection: 10.179281927885349

this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make: 9.024280112435212

it will pass away soon enough: 8.592452076506218

wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs: 10.538286684661607

into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance: 8.812071472641772

but are you pleased jane: 9.618466768194965

on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband: 13.728709865727435

i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not: 11.051196261972827

i began to be afraid you would never come back again: 13.614503448716597

wickham and the officers mr: 12.817396665946655

i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more: 9.983930875276867

elizabeth was forced to go: 8.888582480745939

bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure: 10.22065341550342

he owns it himself without disguise: 6.383404615267976

you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing: 8.938203822421514

upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty: 10.20195019117765

bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood: 13.807295816190939

i wonder that the very pride of this mr: 14.120323333344327

could i expect it to be otherwise: 14.667134217815557

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say: 11.019436572514973

you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour: 9.554171662467976

when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party: 8.29318462591927

her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr: 9.01771148856641

aye so it is cried her mother and mrs: 11.133101845254508

darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her: 7.548591819352966

collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair: 9.62109258640632

elizabeth now began to revive: 9.629055636297478

_that_ is his notion of christian forgiveness: 7.060244672445649

are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do: 12.015323813140443

but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did: 8.908273966923877

there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance: 10.679302854798687

philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs: 9.896658958596435

darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match: 7.643251630808936

the party did not supply much conversation: 10.873206224429504

bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle: 15.616668407449527

she did not choose it said her daughter she would go: 12.887111887176472

wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her: 11.687966086843094

collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs: 10.868268271579048

bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield: 10.041513645606223

philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy: 9.603790782554832

i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring: 8.737935929617029

from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl: 11.014051028366515

my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr: 7.01956813846321

upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock: 7.302665649269557

perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease: 12.139473039560187

i am not afraid of you said he smilingly: 9.260990237521234

my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable: 8.346188198936677

what a stroke was this for poor jane: 6.510987853078481

whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment: 11.001240441501452

darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain: 9.917813940846385

design: 20.075408142571025

she will be taken good care of: 10.008374363230997

did not you: 16.107666218579837

well then you need not be under any alarm: 9.39258550556304

though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit: 9.016827938023926

bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day: 8.300820983622412

fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance: 11.181283203142765

i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection: 9.353316247520922

every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites: 8.079665045672217

if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful: 7.86610883912428

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park: 9.987303694702762

it is really too distressing: 7.863824008413628

i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl: 12.645888933752323

i told my sister philips so the other day: 9.398042442759913

gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party: 9.95623140259089

i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence: 7.675936847991951

as for the gentleman himself _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence: 6.188483099934217

no i believe not: 12.823362712007645

you are then resolved to have him: 11.024573782531675

many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair: 11.955799649434605

a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing: 9.54194421864216

my dear brother replied mrs: 6.339587591623773

nothing that she could say however had any influence: 14.746757037204892

my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family: 9.20293465205319

that is very strange: 11.196944813871383

collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family: 9.456250158703828

i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner: 10.032933724522412

bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual: 7.706455749433125

we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy: 8.85357179078842

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us: 8.55493296976902

an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure: 8.74584666804106

they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families: 7.505753120448113

we never had any governess: 13.218544081960953

it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind: 9.477773214703948

her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone: 13.237168730353352

the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts: 9.32004985032848

she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either: 11.21841800155026

miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room: 9.756393190221383

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune: 8.201622294849681

i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr: 7.017592512399657

it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account: 12.450944064588334

i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses: 8.149188040353382

my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight: 5.8924404255443426

the park was very large and contained great variety of ground: 8.343481763080797

perhaps he thought her too young: 11.473693037488143

she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid: 5.983581663920685

bingley comes my dear said mrs: 8.574707423662465

miss bennet do you know who i am: 15.016502807193966

how i long to see her again: 8.19375286931027

he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr: 9.258472246801082

bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr: 8.069238199745746

who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing: 6.292993156131327

darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son: 10.658974268365927

she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct: 9.833284019718397

the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas: 10.957558598508644

bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love: 9.376533259296531

well: 10.950330338974164

it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us: 7.155470215962199

how i wanted you: 7.824943637890774

and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley: 10.476943930353576

i have every reason in the world to think ill of you: 11.164459613924357

my visit was not long as caroline and mrs: 10.417118544821099

they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are: 10.953748316516183

forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make _me_ your confidante: 8.717262076756166

what i have to say relates to poor lydia: 9.960656670192817

bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library: 10.5647072503401

as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females: 10.6361016142048

sir william did not say much: 11.891221916346076

he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend: 11.038947133665012

elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them: 8.387574505056557

but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is: 9.771678779115916

your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come: 8.174514860717435

but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs: 6.525162994076314

for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials: 11.001566244929059

collins was eloquent in her praise: 9.042254794024753

she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr: 10.301493222973798

can this be mr: 8.001494794324563

unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring: 10.261779470795219

her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies: 8.724379092155818

it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance: 6.286716499225666

bennet could not have chosen better: 9.682323213226688

however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg tm work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg tm web site <URL> you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form: 6.958729558545257

pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr: 7.003295211985179

gardiner smiled: 10.468871341613433

collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly: 7.274152587914984

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow: 9.240948635818917

gardiner though unknown: 8.089893005250843

jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail: 10.240734805185177

darcy by coming in all this state to hear me: 9.086279230537984

charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen: 10.569227559640126

gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else: 9.803473800348401

what could your ladyship propose by it: 7.102200415162365

i do not get on at all: 7.78837568335277

darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress: 7.251550081316752

poor eliza: 11.991261303906594

good bye: 10.171696998831537

she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night: 7.103911604103135

bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard: 9.932655421475976

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences: 10.627628980642623

i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished: 11.05246563884705

bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication: 10.588858632205612

elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old: 11.625806206859044

elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere: 9.674496454442945

bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party: 9.557214439291728

the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr: 9.600828845669959

he deserves to be publicly disgraced: 11.329481220528988

now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy: 8.974551329360647

his words seemed to imply it: 8.53911846841728

jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said mr: 6.126698841672939

i do not think we were speaking at all: 8.291258308256642

she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin: 9.865302410184515

but make a virtue of it by all means: 11.065047813242144

thought she: 19.948434345870496

we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr: 9.528325154363925

i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled: 10.170480984339898

i came to try you: 10.764871120059036

let me know every thing that i am to know without delay: 10.833394015851514

collins made his declaration in form: 6.018315111939855

i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age: 9.904679253634207

your affectionate friend lydia bennet: 7.563122695395726

darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light: 10.94836044478647

they were therefore to go: 11.61569097559145

for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn: 10.156846736114446

wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening: 10.124972556530082

i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had: 12.536321106129778

wickham s attentions: 11.196148923123353

gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly: 8.93308415844569

many stared: 12.092245503645715

the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn: 10.716701811526184

but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family: 10.114590950491305

but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs: 10.639807102567366

well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know: 10.10950683115177

this letter is from mr: 9.481061037205944

if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity: 7.877199343417624

he cannot know what mr: 9.984326414047166

you must learn some of my philosophy: 12.949302670818776

other schemes too came into her head: 8.587223027875266

gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication: 9.305156827814718

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected: 13.30631213030157

lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now: 10.371248708289109

what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening: 10.916154067485111

your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together: 12.364244999590206

the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs: 7.66450779847729

it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living: 9.425608920127878

bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it: 10.68354937732549

i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it: 7.517725302153

it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up: 5.413984224434087

sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves: 10.543872322712126

i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses: 10.390610440310537

darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him: 8.364274213879089

i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn: 8.722730638169551

bingley urged mr: 7.549680195044297

elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain: 12.858853511808148

see <URL> <HASHTAG> n23 mode 2up transcriber s note text enclosed by underscores is in italics _italics_: 3.555153710135058

your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us: 10.144002807217937

upon the whole i am much pleased with him: 12.911683545041567

you are very cautious i suppose as to its _being created_: 8.740107625663503

gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection: 7.740631257698186

they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants: 10.716477233954052

their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had _she_ been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure: 8.29438561902005

she approached and saw the likeness of mr: 7.013994004494043

had the late mr: 10.237990507459315

lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation: 5.329286021989865

i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball: 9.818751910330418

your ladyship wants mr: 7.951702310027988

what should not you mind: 14.036153726698586

and so it does i vow: 10.196173725988649

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty: 6.928370012669449

that mr: 8.434095437947402

bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw: 11.097317527567693

with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield: 10.903622733336949

she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more: 9.004702525780854

it is almost past belief: 7.620744476585595

calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly: 5.658957133295919

my mind was more agreeably engaged: 9.915462450087858

they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring: 10.64897164218512

i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point: 6.847584073961511

i can easily believe it: 8.705627076776002

can it be possible that he will marry her: 11.379892137081908

and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject: 8.914733972691252

yet he knew to the contrary himself: 15.182029397042434

they followed her into the dining parlour: 9.581815246853315

elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance: 11.469359693045996

only look at her: 12.228623390759454

sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty: 8.787692566992241

gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn: 12.311964893981328

i wish i could see her: 10.189310749769232

in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist: 9.065110084822642

she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them: 6.958030600271389

he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others: 13.980991420381383

bingley s love: 10.520351357543607

darcy only entered the room: 7.265410618837921

she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room: 8.267860693396559

this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part: 6.81725445998721

can you deny that you have done it: 13.051052718836356

he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly: 9.494261380569588

that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible: 8.136416541328835

collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance: 7.738830850017011

bennet and nothing can clear mr: 8.079808868817402

how mr: 8.60965703892754

he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted: 9.866088232245211

not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them: 6.414179880550561

wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him: 11.54976619248915

pray do not talk of that odious man: 12.90688414426013

i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted: 9.445417089805689

bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age: 9.040804965217927

you supposed more than really existed: 9.074403109361146

my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace: 11.373171046813829

i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit: 9.855388287972016

_he_ shall be mercenary and _she_ shall be foolish: 10.261281878856945

darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public: 9.314961633621776

what a letter is this to be written at such a moment: 13.292539635051227

i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written: 10.51994255647138

i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied: 6.516484858706251

you must not suspect me: 8.630384646332532

he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry: 7.03845830104264

upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration: 5.5889031124875395

one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight: 16.326959699421824

my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be: 8.42560224425555

surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement: 17.123055886439705

yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again: 10.1861174202119

it must not be thought of: 14.190372003304784

you must not blame my aunt: 9.603060201131616

the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen: 8.336205519164249

your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr: 7.836580238966071

come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly: 9.54124687059839

the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them: 6.972859523185592

and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment: 7.44766242447533

said she as she looked in her face: 18.76468528924545

her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank: 9.641816101225666

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr: 8.928511689922896

i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking: 9.564226361804126

all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road: 11.417759980282995

yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded: 6.784859883539391

you _are_ a gentleman s daughter: 8.419262246973853

she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion: 10.37564634452358

the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary: 8.849033463141472

wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family: 10.20733628882523

in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone: 7.500437505976897

they had long wished to see him: 11.397459388095493

wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish: 6.714847455934616

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr: 9.421694211768616

i do not know when i have been more shocked said she: 9.763596750489086

you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him: 9.604862346425056

there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement: 8.7973038861635

not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise: 13.04261441970302

we must not make him desperate: 11.853161796706171

he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way: 8.758362220733286

the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr: 11.706330123914604

i know no harm of her: 8.829997873607368

darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject: 6.6894948582659195

did mr: 10.546537811709243

said he smiling: 11.961954330571391

certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of _them_: 12.52375273972077

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility: 9.187037623693174

never sir: 12.747462483899278

there is nothing like dancing after all: 7.31641057172842

darcy s steward: 8.784130882872942

collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr: 6.194206263749336

bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him: 9.259503628762321

but whatever may be the sentiments which mr: 8.752138670409682

collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary: 9.199518032382116

gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance: 7.263216866336769

it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening: 9.23671069441783

she enquired after his sister but could do no more: 11.346735163742132

if _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go: 8.527563218079692

the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth: 8.925163964203009

collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness: 11.646181944914924

i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here: 8.683952557496259

oh lydia: 10.619057102698344

i hope we may often meet again: 8.058992443400506

he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention: 9.591026376908768

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them: 9.764071809434913

let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied: 8.451146512941904

his father miss bennet the late mr: 9.054478620328943

perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers: 7.850910462669249

elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home: 11.612372342576197

her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others: 9.598699373255947

letters of business too: 8.005690263127358

something very much to the purpose of course: 16.746122163926078

miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side: 10.255738721676483

her answer was warmly in his favour: 9.459551092544665

she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else: 8.723167211008462

donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations: 5.631117997415367

i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good: 8.643892162970806

she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth: 8.206660330832891

he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner: 7.91957610669788

but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house: 9.485915735443553

he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention: 11.809922454609401

in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived: 11.149361851939625

it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied: 6.86617780198613

by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy: 7.53412549364171

i am perfectly convinced by it that mr: 7.120122457409206

colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman: 6.184035719195975

wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited: 8.493652704697363

here comes hill: 9.053403200262425

i am sick of them all: 9.011761689102235

gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it: 12.348610857698226

jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her: 9.811530139580595

they are gone off together from brighton: 7.666521752326891

what say you mary: 10.06332070445511

<NUM> the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark and any other party distributing a project gutenberg tm electronic work under this agreement disclaim all liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal fees: 5.12165920928171

as she pronounced these words mr: 8.556503627170716

i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former: 11.810420951641602

but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it: 10.790776423538848

darcy but let me not interrupt you sir: 7.029645522035508

my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts: 10.290273275598828

the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic: 9.90064367085196

miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully: 8.46902915468336

darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice: 7.9043606668093505

said jane: 11.921559462542463

the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies: 9.243230544610075

it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man: 8.025148755096424

nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant: 13.553724791549802

and that said mrs: 10.009439763025245

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_: 10.15437738674671

i do not recollect that we did: 7.982987548388578

it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud: 13.440970171822885

i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you: 9.935775884365087

our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly: 8.635223274208716

he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it: 12.352620184099012

lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house: 11.559525727414057

you are very ill: 11.828064252463516

any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <NUM>: 4.127356854947053

no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection: 8.302458344989745

bennet could hardly comprehend it: 7.705801093654562

if your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning: 9.430204675691593

it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor: 9.329055257898855

neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane: 11.010338704479034

darcy s but you shall do as you chuse: 12.09782468933697

lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars: 12.619362437269578

i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle: 8.431927863530698

collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character: 9.130308115138828

on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago: 11.033707687171596

gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion: 13.344715089078734

i can recal nothing worse: 6.8830381449154565

elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name: 9.957940597372362

darcy looked up: 10.20373214034737

when i am in company with him i will not be wishing: 13.088464572839095

next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky: 10.852717759974169

in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other: 11.956729297693785

let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor: 8.364963120207966

did you see him while you were at lambton: 12.828132306209271

she directly replied you need not be frightened: 8.932247054213558

miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present: 9.723524009605674

elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit: 9.957005460513125

she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him: 10.400739782260349

hurst looked at her with astonishment: 13.348439355468598

if i may so express it he has a _right_ to be proud: 11.078653850828012

yes madam all: 8.331030666218556

you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday: 8.303170842705828

she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah: 8.427256799067939

you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us: 6.732536492703437

i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice: 7.15923745469992

it was melancholy to leave her to such society: 11.267218159278098

they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them: 9.300423071762362

no more have i said mr: 9.847098203673733

a person may be proud without being vain: 12.296554107318618

james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look: 9.396250186826054

could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related: 7.486353346562117

he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character: 8.502590785042202

the farewell between herself and mr: 7.784729656799797

but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley: 7.2832954092763345

collins you must marry: 9.938030845514152

upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation: 8.541355053696096

bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh: 7.541992066118545

there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us: 9.286383031000202

but that is not the case _here_: 12.961574161687109

she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there: 9.254064937839408

elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last: 7.632881890851958

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy: 9.882769815611477

her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect: 10.650838097488078

you used us abominably ill answered mrs: 5.491525275308067

i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone: 8.109085069438901

mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them: 10.42268698547024

bennet one communication would therefore do for all: 7.538111241741152

elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley: 7.6828980398958695

they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world: 10.637736784475925

i do not see what right mr: 6.9983184719033185

when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr: 9.754834197377432

it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr: 8.36956333604754

darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing: 8.128610475227037

collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state: 7.96133593079814

my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself: 9.875821666770905

i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself: 8.26588853244657

see paragraph <NUM>: 7.616966115836988

they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea: 9.729436170590528

but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever: 9.137385659142375

my feelings will not be repressed: 12.787165968356486

it is what every body says: 9.326371556768166

he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility: 7.768666790798547

why is not every body as happy: 12.615658746068304

since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been _his_ design: 7.9289176987412455

his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs: 9.756576042150684

she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention: 10.476488285171214

elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time: 10.222219840595614

and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean: 8.034294175804973

bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls: 7.275639712374249

will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties: 7.448286995640252

the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging: 9.899941238811259

he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company: 9.778518913502147

wickham ought not to be a clergyman: 12.083768496091427

of music: 14.74920796367769

was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table: 12.359888969799755

she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when: 12.092391937727875

i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to _you_ or to any person so wholly unconnected with me: 8.013615265111795

he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on: 12.955119677103086

collins began: 10.656787664111624

this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune: 7.1327261328733575

probably not but mr: 11.409848369422914

he takes them now for people of fashion: 6.775339144038588

day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs: 8.904687352390596

he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal: 10.930615060552535

every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight: 10.523727023829423

collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh: 7.286591167021333

john told us mr: 7.462477481647611

she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found: 8.108535831934065

bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection: 8.170874964937571

but really i know not what to say: 9.809778392003391

but i suppose you had no opportunity: 13.074290027361773

the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do: 10.893758490154932

my child let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life: 8.031492443693823

how nicely we are crammed in: 7.352388023955442

my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr: 9.911501267358886

about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged: 9.829275762641034

why must their marriage be private: 7.336629223988712

it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected: 11.291655964360384

philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house: 8.212242127147949

all: 14.959002473921753

caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter: 8.07663124315937

yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever: 12.32526164798324

philips s manners and politeness: 8.897243825882747

she certainly did not hate him: 10.61842146068131

forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked: 10.751374969206342

bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel: 12.573269570117127

if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there: 10.46843219402232

they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland: 7.325396857505593

what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant: 9.329360633040299

he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided: 14.701404445918522

she had a sister married to a mr: 11.440582411027716

kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step: 11.577171236816156

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex: 8.519603758344966

but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it: 11.383322247335165

it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it: 11.908797116761514

her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business: 14.038054680318323

when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared: 9.323368853772529

collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman: 9.240509899577791

four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him: 11.174614229390455

it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned: 10.221468050361096

what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr: 11.416365518992636

but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected: 8.660559121734515

and so is it quite certain he is coming: 12.114847096556025

when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give: 11.911202906149889

her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment: 8.215520996854325

but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due: 8.421372425854884

you have a sweet room here mr: 7.474816808648307

have a little compassion on my nerves: 12.330059426371502

of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough: 8.805477314268007

for the liveliness of your mind i did: 12.826420547435447

nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them: 11.62298941038061

she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken: 8.317942805355942

i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister: 8.542490718917119

and having to relate such a thing of his sister: 13.065943736419452

nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning: 11.189500416840572

what an agreeable man sir william is mr: 8.429691914484923

her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome: 9.313270026870956

he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family: 8.726156840418264

had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place: 9.650907726491889

i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more: 9.814311558601265

how was that possible: 10.28509402481673

he is gone to my father already: 13.051459239490114

gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education: 9.881158258283566

her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr: 11.076037037852005

the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers: 10.182190105791907

my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him: 8.426758678402425

gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how _she_ whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head: 7.429479988103241

bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others: 13.850732403439007

i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together: 10.366331176265533

the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs: 10.029745675077727

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur: 10.273321577930641

well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day: 10.947103605075634

darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency: 9.54698669740664

i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced: 10.685896003419883

chapter xiii: 8.950968636090755

for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation: 13.400092242170338

no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both: 9.04590430976892

bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood: 8.202510738263499

she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley: 12.604723563870282

wickham no i certainly am not: 12.162511199699848

i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family: 13.96593435025357

i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs: 7.436805945979897

one came from her books and the other from her toilette: 15.08695925536185

darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result: 9.258194366944148

but it must not shall not be: 12.444560692267029

excellent parsonage house: 9.411058756414974

it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment: 8.82113259886489

i have heard much of your master s fine person said mrs: 7.585042131371062

and she rose as she spoke: 14.762696554418518

darcy s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient and she read it again: 8.121067189584501

miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane: 9.622508476006056

indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me: 10.544472376865125

elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little: 9.853847594553423

for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr: 11.086719805489624

adieu to disappointment and spleen: 6.503214095157993

to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house: 8.940720253423162

shall you like to have such a brother: 20.10358635663477

this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day: 8.658964822156966

i hope not: 9.60092992652398

it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year: 9.047116515341799

what would i give to hear your strictures on them: 7.43015053908495

i am not likely to leave kent for some time: 8.58164839934378

not one party or scheme or any thing: 7.8826866886102245

and pray may i ask: 9.392495278683107

are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this: 11.32301168868572

she says lizzy had better have taken mr: 7.459018647405325

collins was to attend them at the request of mr: 9.43622048883341

darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture: 7.154824558123863

bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while: 10.661122011766224

make haste and come down this moment: 8.243523179914213

the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained: 8.19204728252352

elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long: 9.04257927831131

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr: 9.288916197785342

it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions: 10.689639752024593

i am perfectly satisfied: 7.309107466626126

read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about: 9.886391944031205

philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before: 8.308519647961342

lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way: 10.685296844566517

gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr: 9.545070551421917

allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place: 10.24902484798351

and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing mr: 5.705764087342002

then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr: 13.114675685397305

but why mr: 8.129789961418325

collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor: 10.06581525890427

fairbanks ak <NUM>: 6.500984513784365

we must have mrs: 10.459020548874044

collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte: 7.168288063997186

he leaves out half his words and blots the rest: 5.632157865175817

why will you think so: 11.988081511357562

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs: 8.507498302679398

teaze him laugh at him: 8.123155094624094

they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose: 8.774000206155545

her hair so untidy so blowsy: 5.358853357969656

you may as well call it impertinence at once: 7.884035869172263

he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances: 10.282616143369754

i did not expect such a compliment: 13.01701541918238

how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine: 8.009060994074874

could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts: 10.892139066658892

they are in the same profession you know only in different lines: 9.982275463292929

it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us: 14.073380373088845

nay said elizabeth this is not fair: 15.176095096416182

u: 16.517683214156893

darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself: 9.959320524242115

first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room: 13.571880397915221

this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once: 8.592385730061725

i: 7.015429825494975

my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london: 12.629633567420434

email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s web site and official page at <URL> for additional contact information dr: 5.572244881637702

she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour: 10.442041172640435

bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected: 10.283480901718935

collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary: 11.275748761293677

had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you: 7.849644743279552

had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her: 8.88524451093758

let me mend it for you: 9.057351319915183

darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented: 9.857816464223207

bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr: 8.161007910882098

an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham: 8.930247014857573

i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner: 7.3154908334500846

yet why did he come: 10.378414769900836

collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife: 9.609318370952435

he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former: 10.497375153169477

but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used: 9.700013624611747

the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt: 7.42690217629969

i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr: 7.811550576913599

kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room: 9.374569736905102

and one of my own daughters: 16.800337138397083

my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr: 6.823514172689825

he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend: 8.747517850209787

said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply: 12.797194129280456

these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature: 9.490641499987891

he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows: 13.625207204372705

how odious i should think them: 9.71340922663732

the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement: 10.911695516444778

with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself: 10.721085459667412

elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr: 7.962956089839637

they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to: 5.763049958093446

i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel: 9.434254340273318

that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice: 9.088174685700722

my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else: 9.79255981799318

he is not at all liked in hertfordshire: 11.43871747819847

and yet how many things have happened: 8.815103365992908

his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal: 9.328894213551106

lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites: 11.569283947149234

and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now: 11.426951875400105

we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun: 6.46641497266329

if you will believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight: 9.745669213347366

pray tell your sister that i long to see her: 12.055638578294783

what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err: 10.316984540573637

gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself: 8.498799760410176

his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice: 12.060151782204821

they have some of the finest woods in the country: 11.855673942654533

she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word: 10.430026654237318

you did: 12.492926509571959

the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side: 6.428829717176669

at such a distance as _that_ you know things are strangely misrepresented: 8.341366889814642

bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed: 9.891839717417005

his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her: 8.922096383830866

a little time therefore: 13.747633001102692

collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed: 7.546534401011138

elizabeth felt jane s pleasure: 11.728919150468542

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was: 9.172187893268543

well lizzy said mrs: 8.80322752608698

denny and mr: 8.440097432859067

bennet could hardly contain herself: 7.930781817530234

there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters: 7.7864619913297615

they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr: 10.754058757077706

elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal: 9.985606958660588

no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it: 11.114834213256128

the room in which the ladies sat was backwards: 11.974753569476722

he has _some_ friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves: 10.593172070167276

the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw: 10.315265940852765

reynolds s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master: 9.269969108197897

the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke: 9.975168585576872

but we are all liable to error: 8.799388799507698

but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable: 8.12560423422772

wickham and herself: 9.220266284774446

their table was superlatively stupid: 6.0646007443720285

come kitty i want you up stairs: 8.127216131323966

i thought we never should have got into the coach: 11.069130772507165

special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg tm concept and trademark: 5.6360460847599425

do your sisters play and sing: 7.2209861095729515

elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more: 8.009978088435938

wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant: 10.037576925817868

tis too much: 10.7275734324633

what do you mean hill: 9.006092925983015

her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious: 10.23614744093082

having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business: 9.89278739634814

i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news: 10.187555786473533

the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground: 9.82979137214752

this was a lucky idea of mine indeed: 9.155106834711546

one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn: 10.889261105403596

i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh: 6.391819889862684

darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once: 10.91615792442788

bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball: 11.539328947852356

there was no want of discourse: 10.324143099985076

any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far: 10.856401089191255

elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together: 10.621796037499024

i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you: 8.296819819244105

he is nothing to us you know and i am sure _i_ never want to see him again: 11.41169715186862

in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere: 7.295824865313542

i must not decide on my own performance: 10.329280479733505

since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy: 12.447080097536329

to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <URL> while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate: 5.159065832205841

elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible: 9.336225821400468

what a pity it is mamma we did not all go: 12.347068745734264

darcy who sat opposite to them: 7.538012803698548

once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear: 7.857528099994789

on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must: 12.857368468152139

may i ask to what these questions tend: 7.772306301197131

i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her: 9.92096326080462

it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long: 11.509648676016523

while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr: 6.472816871692269

the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants: 9.276219727057171

you have delighted us long enough: 8.242898133522477

bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies: 11.194089778865962

your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence: 12.714010254553996

it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single: 8.284440322111735

the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual: 9.897081330996356

she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness: 10.719718245861001

one must speak a little you know: 12.894681641399915

i never can be thankful mr: 9.433865222281785

he seldom appeared really animated: 6.520630845532076

poor little lizzy: 9.003485570892144

darcy may hug himself: 6.217933515010179

that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home: 15.046927302644903

he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away: 12.120677255779777

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home: 8.822917809937517

she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse: 7.056899117019446

it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man: 11.921398493453848

but my dearest love tell me what dish mr: 6.904866853767592

lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr: 9.03550032958159

it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling: 6.143797415315688

miss bingley i am sure cannot: 10.388866538855442

everything wore a happier aspect: 6.262282407016599

all young ladies accomplished: 11.727935723231132

gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face: 12.751544147427637

there is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping i dare say: 5.670823936892906

there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste: 7.43706152298038

bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them: 9.796792618142407

but no one can throw any blame on them: 6.420102112909681

bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter: 10.608875492816734

mary and kitty were both with mrs: 8.007463261158476

bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance: 8.6670690940019

clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish: 10.230681200901426

one does not know what to think: 12.731311986973605

how much you must have gone through: 12.980157040112145

we acted with the best intentions: 13.029828784991674

they must all go to brighton: 8.956124822960708

darcy is uncommonly kind to mr: 6.682806316358716

they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable: 9.575215313414528

wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once: 9.751989181265433

i assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town: 11.391392260920853

and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information: 8.051381561188006

what do you keep winking at me for: 8.249366914054962

she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable: 8.48547181661614

i should infinitely prefer a book: 6.896975733096158

why must _she_ be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold: 9.861063622292372

very true my dear that is exactly what i say: 12.068317124380664

he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard: 9.991970130657714

darcy can please where he chuses: 8.023618938367909

but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her: 10.866165493806763

you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind: 8.676477143477541

it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour: 11.564777577448734

from what can it proceed: 12.067259964102753

you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage: 8.478619931006012

in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him: 8.029735293185738

she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another: 7.852612065862754

he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from _that_ i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before: 9.795081927464045

you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night: 9.49513953909306

shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers: 8.20183420905914

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all: 9.39960100380757

but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice: 8.057521781187775

when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for: 8.523013832268125

and with a bow to mr: 8.469201610532382

the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone: 9.036835725627094

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends: 10.243653517286528

let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence: 7.132922349925697

wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs: 7.078687057521132

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c: 6.463223407001794

he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done: 10.063052385991634

they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her: 11.835786742776587

and she was only sixteen last june: 9.252050075213116

it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum: 7.296657740970154

we cannot suppose he would help it if he could: 12.35056666891241

younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what: 10.204880282075992

could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster: 10.929996114921021

two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it: 15.377542979035452

collins s correspondence for any consideration: 8.98335374992922

i am glad he is gone: 9.726222472182094

you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate: 12.491578854594719

it must be my uncle s doings: 10.013318300736646

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation: 6.366502358722108

shall we ask your cousin the reason of this: 8.058150669307931

hill began instantly to express her joy: 8.397190161338626

bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time: 10.13320215506006

you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one: 8.622298414369942

all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum: 7.339198412818791

royalty payments must be paid within <NUM> days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns: 5.637598492121744

the tumult of her mind was now painfully great: 11.25010393448687

jane was distressed: 10.280085719761281

from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent: 16.47441074526182

it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well: 7.208667365124794

i am sorry it went off: 5.976987657617962

when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm: 8.35242581292153

but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley and _her_ being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea: 9.540506561018383

but does not jane correspond with the sister: 12.167252655576824

i believe i have now told you every thing: 10.464012025928277

and to be kept back on _such_ a motive: 9.368990054113983

you have employed your time much better: 8.948189699272355

jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr: 12.351777780894205

i hope there was: 11.717729498475126

you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude: 5.665605987983643

put them next to your great uncle the judge: 7.684259832469226

the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met: 10.831746803295824

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs: 10.939675965041163

how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you: 9.612842134306229

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room: 9.153537732538428

i will make no promise of the kind: 12.818856410985394

she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening: 11.200991057515305

wickham we are brother and sister you know: 11.569057619043273

darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend: 9.682417880921182

we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word: 13.170439544229469

at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters: 10.977134965365241

as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_: 11.020115599727214

aye that is because you have the right disposition: 14.041899142705306

to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long: 8.994529032155052

darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme: 10.46444211102831

yes she did: 12.20035428043749

darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself: 12.445797087910918

hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr: 8.679099426495625

the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence: 11.125549022370581

she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away: 12.433270059150248

i know we dine with four and twenty families: 7.264622285685604

reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him: 10.105307228449895

he had never had the slightest suspicion: 11.747750511574193

every savage can dance: 6.86341728643128

darcy had much better finish his letter: 8.097369872192443

how humiliating is this discovery: 8.578199949709004

gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation: 12.184722116523169

i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips: 11.489593890517419

_that_ is all settled: 11.480317379200692

i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him and _to_ him too freely: 7.556017266921181

at present i am not in love with mr: 11.3950426100492

and do you like her: 13.227480808301959

she will drop the acquaintance entirely: 8.26143173235981

yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly: 8.068757255953004

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr: 12.755455939862237

your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done: 13.119540007361492

the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees: 12.057337163543032

a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter: 8.898670105215903

nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts: 10.024443252141872

he has more to give: 14.178365436086724

a little: 14.573334020466374

darcy had voluntarily done for lydia: 7.518941435420503

i should as soon call her mother a wit: 9.581305602781596

darcy and herself: 9.446306489538697

and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr: 6.870290447977851

there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings: 6.564159040293762

lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on mr: 6.376366800381155

it was only said lately george wickham esq: 6.943675921308862

because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement: 9.815975877318692

the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages: 7.1223790354630445

i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one: 9.217768759289923

the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings: 7.939760415344606

you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled: 11.36835863192013

well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss: 12.464850880281524

collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority: 10.036744527195692

he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum: 8.3517112574354

i can hardly write for laughing: 7.847156352059698

james s with very decent composure: 5.8468890183856

philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin: 6.775683964954288

a young man such as you describe mr: 11.515857080794333

darcy said nothing at all: 8.856938238071592

but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable: 7.316597388317809

edw: 16.517768732311186

do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will: 8.380357101082861

in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of: 10.679075257222623

i must be in town next saturday: 10.596961853682327

i am going away myself: 7.376717021970165

bennet sent to mr: 7.475676786768739

after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display: 9.004238412340683

his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time: 10.843134723617863

but georgiana would not join her: 9.874130702395657

two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs: 7.898256243076141

gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days: 9.951627799863772

elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill: 9.62599090345779

the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth: 6.358184743945028

so much the man of fashion: 13.354875480138354

i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind: 10.567628776161698

by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of: 9.130334268857975

there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him: 10.810696061588962

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr: 6.787311200005157

she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain: 12.810626478539568

he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing: 9.542866441624428

without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first: 7.986134893689487

and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection: 13.128522673159248

your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month: 9.582331852627103

elizabeth was in agonies: 10.901415012731887

now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr: 8.095021338277748

wickham had resolved on quitting the militia: 7.99128416948921

you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous: 6.363852840322979

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted: 7.679282479614522

as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out: 9.858703978571386

wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia: 9.807447366418453

but vanity not love has been my folly: 7.635194710277332

i am so grieved for him: 6.758863714701041

but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s: 10.470935123666678

and pray what sort of guardians do you make: 9.875694674931035

miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense: 7.506927860078617

she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr: 6.412698782664405

the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh: 8.777831135742034

darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this: 8.599789846588319

it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs: 7.4119775504129635

your younger sisters must be very young: 14.706300218440624

never mind miss lizzy s hair: 7.357431474007853

bennet made no answer: 6.989793471074033

they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer: 10.687650699306037

nor i i am sure said miss bingley: 9.383912224016939

i have not _that_ pain: 7.347801016496115

wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house: 13.17829701384036

my sweetest lizzy: 8.335819895356593

yes yes they must marry: 8.532742873322288

teazing teazing man: 9.133856755142917

may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study: 7.534842507208233

lizzy said he what are you doing: 11.876172332916395

they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better: 7.820474481135863

she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley: 10.980610615690297

of having another daughter married to mr: 8.43980057190193

you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me: 8.62485642716885

he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear: 14.255406824952331

collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself: 4.938348735614991

with the officers: 16.46054021846336

collins was a most humiliating picture: 10.33098308960924

it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that: 9.625944483572901

bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals: 12.369949003704605

absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr: 6.114800290821099

there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself: 18.089682060820728

is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses: 12.042845474671022

as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer: 15.147667140260419

elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr: 10.668708150227435

every body is disgusted with his pride: 10.85010789648738

and do you really love him quite well enough: 10.174809088430246

my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england: 6.887703439018917

i have not a doubt of mr: 8.613867582567684

her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered: 6.756396547263113

about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her: 9.315382236852514

miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him: 11.301706181393373

what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have: 6.440669370672208

the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse: 5.766885863824814

a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on: 9.679830156250993

he studies too much for words of four syllables: 7.09481194005245

gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr: 7.393173963557467

i shall certainly try to get the better: 7.513748518259092

their powers of conversation were considerable: 8.042228509179807

darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster: 9.462869503595925

as they drove to mr: 8.30199068764742

no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room: 9.595404117272277

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world: 8.440174357388173

blame you: 12.873962201862742

darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away: 9.150765489146728

not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves: 8.358788717286428

there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome: 6.097882898883001

she will be down in a moment i dare say: 11.136278971260948

she shared in their attendance on mrs: 7.409868167837222

she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage: 8.568448081584823

yet indeed i am in earnest: 14.055869226775306

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs: 6.724385419646076

elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation: 9.732889031197729

they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses: 3.7876464635620803

bingley s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham: 9.315057482916826

bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing: 10.347144134104932

where does discretion end and avarice begin: 5.5191473800676265

scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs: 8.185533992299208

now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence: 7.085968058810382

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure: 10.189227142465931

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted: 7.649298037220269

wickham passed all his youth there you know: 8.398107600776074

she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years: 10.4875187522249

but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes: 11.148207604121215

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance: 9.41850805690099

only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time: 10.054377925836514

she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry: 9.656189487338152

but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited: 8.682541582126666

bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia: 6.993663177379123

his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost: 11.996941496752521

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind: 9.746461428321116
