i enquired after their brother of course: 154.67222590994743

we had better not mention it: 74.65918002639604

can i speak plainer: 136.7035815229522

mrs: 3.8175662746206735

and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house: 348.8681146098206

mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance: 426.8042915503193

_that_ abominable mr: 209.57238304444252

though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness: 330.16731895455194

contact the foundation as set forth in section <NUM> below: 206.1187074436597

i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself: 265.996137761263

if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 79.37083433425997

she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr: 75.13122544397031

a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little: 383.49081286533794

you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this: 190.0947436776506

your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with: 157.91302124029806

but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice: 330.0618552670089

she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr: 380.5544136227432

he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia: 365.6548993193327

upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person: 302.000678433646

his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart: 206.96637133325518

he is indeed: 34.731556229441125

she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false: 127.23673009130802

i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent: 197.35348318631102

darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine: 456.77387589967697

no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting: 308.28403927288343

merely to the illustration of _your_ character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity: 1000.0

bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage: 371.77366314228385

as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr: 362.3324064449437

he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments: 256.0601961228347

my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you: 348.6291348588056

people _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true: 363.451744979905

what advantage can it be to you to offend mr: 276.6637167452897

could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections: 155.20965772810237

and what am i to do on the occasion: 34.908746335451056

as soon as ever mr: 9.864469671573788

if he wants our society let him seek it: 258.6582802403435

darcy in a most infamous manner: 69.93197883517063

gardiner: 8.113436642672694

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away: 362.25981974084385

when first mr: 81.99464519179354

i pity though i cannot help blaming her: 211.8099505686321

pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen: 55.357203986714225

such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret: 380.8516964508389

charlotte says she hardly ever does: 376.5577315864557

darcy were by no means over: 65.57689562146841

dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations: 373.88784268192035

collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty: 562.0407621344887

gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send: 129.45254573207922

i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare: 198.92394601321163

on being made acquainted with the present mr: 97.60390995950746

kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs: 73.11509256299789

she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her: 314.76123045155055

girls can i do any thing for you in meryton: 410.0645058868663

mr: 3.2198495402876337

in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr: 356.2595858288071

you may have drawn him in: 103.64842407611363

you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it: 206.96854871718546

darcy and herself: 9.446306489538697

bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before: 352.250272734839

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr: 71.60222068908371

elizabeth could not but look surprised: 55.8305869380596

my temper would perhaps be called resentful: 315.63950674671975

he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity: 86.96576381819841

darcy is engaged to _my daughter_: 76.79725156285403

darcy for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved: 272.60258058864144

ring the bell kitty for hill: 488.2899531322983

though mr: 128.12525352884367

jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news: 232.05382754147197

darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection: 209.33515141837543

gardiner soon wrote again to his brother: 52.106774253434835

but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation: 295.6338709739535

she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting: 78.17990781612728

but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her: 198.59749847693732

from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr: 240.34358888659753

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza: 406.28369904217163

bingley: 7.073460734909499

but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr: 254.2359018218585

what are you telling miss bennet: 60.29476797959353

but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments: 268.9631145959385

what do you think: 20.150482669165704

she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham: 377.16771231835446

bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth: 105.99886994738421

this is wholly unexpected: 33.864915048699935

their reception from mr: 48.848746683648805

but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise: 417.0618728072449

he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty: 123.58022156198267

miss elizabeth bennet: 63.91346198096634

you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it: 159.78872696707774

they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street: 245.32128925681607

darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all: 134.01283751020492

though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it: 151.70743512362486

bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery: 350.61621086230076

what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here: 127.88417150051383

his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter: 489.1770511540232

he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all: 194.2147713689428

she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way: 197.3680883582416

and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself: 62.77268130771695

when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful: 287.3211878873042

after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr: 126.58974722325539

with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs: 463.2382463519468

every thing that is charming: 36.580829964138196

there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs: 102.79838697308067

you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan: 247.30638938582916

as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister: 125.55153201306929

do you think it incredible that mr: 61.111323838033684

good or bad: 63.618592204619674

i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things: 255.56349547354182

said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest I am the tallest: 409.0874123745443

but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground: 288.935580928196

if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think: 114.67409313252169

another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you: 184.23338315625134

oh: 4.372841025735526

e: 6.293800138039335

she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits: 114.27754121389057

_you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it: 107.91869633813823

my dear you flatter me: 70.44572406014572

james s: 8.811373527756869

miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before: 140.11581487187075

both changed colour one looked white the other red: 557.4934066387148

your mother must have been quite a slave to your education: 254.24925866847613

wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight: 88.37796762986689

jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr: 183.90807311332858

it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind: 377.77248088535737

but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled: 184.68301427181174

but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure: 192.3889619757038

and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books: 325.9054648660269

she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper: 248.94568869227012

young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way: 301.1713097975133

my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me: 279.1586038461772

bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match: 190.81774369569212

at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr: 206.43698597499477

my motive for cautioning you is as follows: 149.18138861303152

come here child cried her father as she appeared: 512.9416558217636

in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was: 243.75840863739256

his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue: 227.21580398758528

yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished: 127.50829929533894

no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you: 198.71177160475102

darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr: 115.8573500038352

_i_ talked about the dance and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples: 382.1237369207599

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy: 218.96881039974372

no not at all: 35.26730212122986

gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it: 346.05709967540577

their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency: 195.42558260966177

she is not such a simpleton: 42.88913471469281

i beg your pardon: 16.046319126044448

what is the matter: 19.46404775839411

they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit: 283.70814263887127

but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves: 111.4787585173174

if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it: 189.81766708022593

elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement: 188.9572851065734

mary and kitty thank heaven: 29.723087563936758

so genteel and so easy: 302.34512023549337

obstinate headstrong girl: 1000.0

bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter: 433.3229006091465

she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter: 167.44406906650363

s: 16.836706329303418

about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand: 362.1832539773884

but you have chosen your fault well: 134.2952220848486

bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr: 255.8046563620799

was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield: 356.725916926817

how much of good or evil must be done by him: 59.258414151167784

pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself: 368.2606622195634

philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body: 90.48706398554222

but she had no reason to fear mr: 29.378674706652447

you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me: 363.02608020521944

darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy: 104.06127106431808

at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer: 298.8308196733105

she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs: 273.45510968295855

hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest: 263.9448494516367

if _she_ does not object to it why should _we_: 208.90320578341496

her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable: 183.59370298422158

when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject: 236.82674778090944

nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world: 439.66943882915365

but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized: 407.38351792967103

i knew how it would be: 16.262846175140663

bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own: 259.55896879292385

elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce: 131.41711318402665

i wish you had been there: 12.382879451026623

gardiner left them soon after breakfast: 127.82137421000421

the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again: 375.82694073715015

and if i am that choice why may not i accept him: 130.44165620204583

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs: 63.205975681630186

i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either: 244.39134988354317

i am astonished my dear said mrs: 26.093262217437836

he heard her with astonishment: 27.4231580950731

elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes: 469.2991647861635

there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects: 175.5860649604214

good gracious: 8.163605883269796

how are they even to be discovered: 254.03204461069444

but before they heard again from mr: 125.93197478710817

there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much: 227.40720637800092

we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply: 237.55994831337696

bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene: 167.7877393638946

elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere: 289.2224453374682

bennet were dead: 108.81454089245419

elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship: 203.89150320572116

yes: 9.220623175163682

d: 1000.0

bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it: 511.13966128705397

the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her: 331.12364600530185

yes indeed cried mrs: 38.97460971513562

and so did mrs: 32.96171197281024

she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so: 130.70688419356722

as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes: 292.59650924930145

i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together: 148.53345091459553

jane now came up: 214.72001758930898

and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule: 308.2020622235921

<NUM>: 5.188117464510374

promise me therefore to come to hunsford: 227.70634597677696

vol: 13.110144761836318

yes my youngest is not sixteen: 295.2554123299243

as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth: 190.45752951378014

bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters: 37.86421469287971

are you quite sure madam: 45.757797657427396

bennet s ill humour or ill health: 181.14306151396164

her report was highly favourable: 236.13063054297797

elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation: 377.474605074342

there was also a postscript to this effect: 77.67439206511737

i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox: 169.41920764260917

collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter: 208.59783764530448

one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad: 567.133472658262

stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all: 671.8020519917582

i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes: 32.37091635412465

the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them: 135.22878479532255

and you only the second: 150.29949044374334

believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire: 303.0831634605081

collins in describing the civility of mr: 33.64680521944546

collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character: 247.8408730376486

f: 7.427115530702453

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless: 231.05974518054714

collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings: 179.34951800501264

miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be: 183.2890344749598

i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior: 366.25177985861376

i have already told her so once by your desire: 226.1581596219784

because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it: 312.37757400674775

well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr: 302.15140980155905

the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience: 291.9053035113784

bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him: 130.26828172637659

and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice: 374.3132750223947

a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago: 259.5637205081156

with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms: 204.81728511850858

wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr: 108.60443389915197

susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough: 828.2403131590411

bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity: 234.79501890685773

will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again: 119.96036517130187

pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p: 214.4357016684904

their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge: 399.6931228796837

my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect: 289.6599066558722

by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song: 349.02514474685626

who should suffer but myself: 129.72311676521426

but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed: 129.6554835934254

collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless: 299.9807109582335

it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled: 128.4180571104225

collins by jane s introduction of him: 105.15278089101938

yet now i must believe you cried jane: 274.15269115826993

gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance: 293.9911075593215

but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object: 72.05600313593374

in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her: 448.00509142665175

you forget that i have made no answer: 38.43030039982515

certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it: 668.5179497371025

the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions: 429.0026748038962

at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here: 201.52845092285824

but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion: 298.3975679183302

they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance: 242.98150705664912

people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking: 448.3861981750983

morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week: 263.717567297032

chapter xiii: 8.950968636090755

when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr: 224.0986256360728

their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs: 493.1568371831352

miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with: 111.17130276345874

having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs: 282.1234385490985

in a few days mr: 42.236129958468396

no no you shall not deceive me: 138.9902941498754

they were not the only objects of mr: 60.84171907840758

you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say: 57.696158035537216

denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here: 309.37993290412476

the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever: 138.06093685345334

there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law: 251.8207397970213

ah: 11.452771295083007

very very much: 76.61582781890627

with _your_ good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others: 145.75803551854298

it was lady catherine de bourgh: 8.058859942734653

bingley is not he: 75.35387947748212

no lizzy that is what i do _not_ choose: 154.40228988844055

elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing: 99.53476941350085

london printed for t: 6.856895314763031

lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth: 306.30219784636097

their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago: 353.373511832587

it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world: 113.6017079582803

i wish i could call her amiable: 69.3507581230378

darcy: 5.138661843959479

they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something: 162.88066464459953

all loveliness and goodness as she is: 277.0597675930451

younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement: 506.29118822916524

i know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder: 142.4427922017212

perhaps i do: 35.3138939939286

one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding i believe: 145.10162849656808

but my father cannot: 50.798518748410906

about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon: 391.23308316558524

i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did: 136.49390338530227

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs: 276.33777303694717

we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode: 544.609747653171

happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance: 591.802506818728

darcy with him and sat down again by her sister: 36.4220220859965

and is this all: 115.51589650319148

it will not do: 27.030506577970378

she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence: 215.23384444993945

the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street: 413.9687142256259

now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence: 308.38654371261424

bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card: 263.987046325738

their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget: 644.7254147012976

and mrs: 5.067136686927331

only think what an establishment it would be for one of them: 58.44451669451273

long and the gouldings soon: 178.60530255689926

i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion: 326.2170034800651

gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive: 151.44573290089943

miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it: 46.83349252556413

respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown: 820.8447941365357

she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration: 294.7164359734274

i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn: 126.94023855172351

bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family: 169.70819764389805

at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage: 284.0077513814298

my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction: 281.8271483782497

_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever: 447.8467659520585

she answered him with cold civility: 61.10667171971659

darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel: 214.1486940990193

transcriber s note spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book: 582.8330767512431

gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated: 500.23140348467206

your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you: 131.30065969907116

his manners are very different from his cousin s: 90.71831225871264

as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner: 219.201856001875

with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed: 496.54304981668565

reynolds could interest her on no other point: 457.79191883004796

collins has made you an offer of marriage: 12.553520975511756

when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument: 358.1795354362476

and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission: 451.6844846663239

i who have prided myself on my discernment: 300.5371469142322

the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres: 298.1932163935813

which do you mean: 90.59238657234319

darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former: 200.40169501947523

his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother: 160.05597817898945

your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds: 442.05633787162316

when i went away i felt that it would soon happen: 63.2065835832647

pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned: 406.9484629249641

engaged to mr: 119.5860002344127

it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of _some_ conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible: 172.0564787644592

what is it you mean: 26.07307674464889

i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy: 174.98698163522982

no thanks to his gallantry for that: 211.22856900850238

dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered: 174.83105148048898

hurst had a house: 127.27215167582662

your mother insists upon your accepting it: 242.3742958863865

when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence: 370.910237393128

my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cannot think: 172.04729846576603

darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began: 340.4705452481652

darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for: 244.9581618471432

that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts: 462.4448929859642

before any answer could arrive from mr: 254.63070488084426

and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters: 52.69511575357839

on both sides it was only assertion: 151.4667157519274

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way: 143.494933493833

i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power: 122.25719501930661

he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks: 310.0835868169839

wickham for the last time: 120.84722048862828

elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made: 346.4570201181956

but it is of small importance: 30.759372781627768

i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible: 160.67824664545148

and what sort of table do they keep: 96.01608301810926

there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake: 360.39042585988545

see paragraph <NUM>: 7.616966115836988

the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand: 267.7489109509319

well cried elizabeth have it as you choose: 223.09211634582618

yet how just a humiliation: 322.0548475104689

philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could: 319.0800975149344

i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object: 188.69697760527612

pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before: 360.2171406050292

their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme: 414.4096337986706

darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr: 89.90189442076856

to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point: 285.03275772228204

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk: 122.95123876815511

i know how much you dislike him: 86.21967472396462

the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense: 336.41101260046

at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr: 146.87598123222782

darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise: 234.5733357184836

you must contrive to send somebody: 157.43528684712876

he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded: 298.18880527735365

colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr: 126.3789463709051

have all her friends left her: 268.19135068951454

she complained bitterly of all this to her husband: 87.19330914816331

you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage: 281.3791618504702

if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry: 420.80171702462667

bennet: 6.742912389002258

you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these: 237.90802259964929

in this danger kitty is also comprehended: 235.4335653383752

his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend: 325.8787624153594

the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity: 414.14089790368104

_i_ never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united: 238.24277206296475

she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over: 167.8274084860449

he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long: 250.14574041422213

his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it: 202.71515785775563

but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride: 297.7998194232084

i expected you to stay two months: 75.86426187079627

who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away: 333.4817474588869

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning: 136.96790624562647

perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation: 457.1324242819601

to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing: 237.4929158630598

lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room: 132.2393657307384

i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she: 57.42191990535701

elizabeth almost stared at her: 115.49043377631835

i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas: 367.21053531962554

i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her: 270.2358789580367

oh yes: 7.138890274159456

we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary: 162.3388810292057

every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness: 86.29795897781304

but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good: 148.77333309572415

i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am: 350.5320924942165

collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement: 570.0838579403734

observed mrs: 1000.0

wickham only shook his head: 46.65521590088558

i thought i should have died: 59.169186558736286

if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr: 354.40242873201345

bingley is coming down sister for mrs: 114.0847400986353

you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite: 446.51394424817477

how can it affect them: 138.30214527312873

that that is the worst of all: 81.10333636765309

i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other: 112.77590018325328

darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him: 218.3598101284553

miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs: 281.31658765150917

he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man: 79.50338798955983

let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance: 347.41731995165446

have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity: 204.07157041182853

they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved: 258.153141207851

of mr: 10.099725205278082

my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me: 420.8049551406095

but you _will_ know it when i have told you what happened the very next day: 158.72753180356838

is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w: 177.44855117460315

she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery: 368.86016760559414

said elizabeth to herself: 44.41889339975217

my dear jane mr: 41.85568059235568

you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy: 253.8173866267294

sir william only smiled: 92.48111895548857

for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line: 273.06929094776655

but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone: 330.05975877982945

they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day: 267.95911683645426

my aunt told me so herself on saturday: 111.99061708536465

darcy is: 26.20003943308412

she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained: 360.49426194020225

it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations: 90.15134866055894

and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley: 213.40372012072203

i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood: 103.38312483569732

in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better: 328.9261644179577

the business was therefore soon settled: 133.50499689253283

the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent: 242.3991404519459

long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided: 177.99334163725996

you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age: 108.2325760704904

she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions: 131.13569103193066

ten thousand pounds: 8.25991212426833

i who have valued myself on my abilities: 300.5371469142322

bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on: 517.8246025004349

_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr: 218.93303829252207

but my dear you must indeed go and see mr: 43.38799666745317

elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma: 223.60905652151797

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield: 272.282310915009

bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon: 364.86350396422176

i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london: 153.6072145604117

you look pale: 113.59284415712588

this is your final resolve: 84.9788174936001

the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation: 78.14293897489911

chapter xi: 7.526837439137147

and his answering immediately to the last question oh: 193.24857107766982

i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to: 297.1891855107309

far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter: 288.11150149151797

but you do not know _all_: 47.04365068164873

bennet exceedingly: 62.49692759192864

his character was decided: 23.448474936659427

bennet give up the point: 47.972688383994935

he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please: 224.81845650398589

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home: 167.96391525494892

i am afraid mr: 33.1250032063101

but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks: 246.56619047653146

but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me: 94.23011361608687

is nothing due to me on that score: 419.84448791500245

from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr: 251.0692203525589

there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself: 255.35441543904517

elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom: 450.8028548433667

on their being joined by mr: 54.37421536752481

when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication: 186.92684508307823

how shall i bear so much happiness: 267.198623559969

lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living: 132.7761211440354

i should never have said mrs: 25.03673863008301

if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed: 274.5615136220978

elizabeth shook her head over this letter: 156.75017040219177

hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward: 317.39095840303213

good heaven: 10.03026584406685

he is come mr: 20.31581495934634

and may i ask: 31.114476429287134

always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body: 366.86634619126966

in the evening soon after mr: 47.926460472524994

he cannot afford it: 133.6550555841894

she declared her resolution: 149.4720411580437

this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for: 261.31968150187765

bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield: 394.7957976409316

darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter: 100.19643508859289

i admire all my three sons in law highly said he: 298.94171006899904

she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay: 194.6313394116768

arguments are too much like disputes: 723.6158134087975

no no this is not likely: 85.85481902912812

she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle: 266.7356809859189

how he lived i know not: 116.59630407121787

their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr: 557.1750097255498

miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose: 238.6479377987735

what a fine thing for our girls: 209.27248331778432

they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas: 300.8955004653107

i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals: 430.6048548923118

i need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable: 446.9917389531662

darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr: 182.55278509397024

i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that _you_ that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr: 409.18643465208817

she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country: 195.83280630032294

were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express: 157.15923121364153

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all: 342.80317465765205

remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin: 437.17994079626993

it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family: 46.54697783017429

well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better: 213.42201703279338

collins was also in the same state of angry pride: 227.06289592892583

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family: 160.33023110179028

bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her: 291.2265506972099

they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream: 495.38905796216693

philips: 52.77755799168255

we are not in a way to know _what_ mr: 95.21833841740012

i told mrs: 18.005916316415586

in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference: 177.6005761132617

she cried: 10.208913524331203

he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump: 406.1897144073823

i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with: 231.75003162695944

the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs: 412.74096863389667

lizzy you must not do so: 27.917761149877467

she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two: 187.04145793775388

this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled: 410.48941553270873

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained: 361.5313411506968

undoubtedly: 147.88223536891746

and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications: 114.38728114040303

bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time: 144.52678948089294

denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr: 296.2643432038185

wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr: 109.56952565019819

bingley will dance with you at the next ball: 69.08851309374339

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance: 317.66498341789645

he begged pardon for having displeased her: 264.03131829670184

said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate: 213.20162300199678

he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it: 235.93439470120907

my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them: 101.43151606072547

he replied and was again silent: 159.14795994781963

your humility mr: 151.1442907048303

jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better: 463.4345953620629

i speak nothing but the truth: 71.9618034028772

the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr: 230.30190744859837

when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal: 464.3609498482139

accompanied by a violent yawn: 1000.0

his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father: 329.24291165871546

her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it: 103.99523379754115

collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair: 352.6084107517741

cried jane what do you mean sir: 88.7442083408681

bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces: 275.7809544411919

forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton: 208.71219796894604

pray read on: 72.53751604530943

aye there she comes continued mrs: 180.49873544641966

let me congratulate you on a very important conquest: 262.9645282590502

the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies: 338.62042411600174

do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place: 70.01560668293236

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day: 141.84084515878706

you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence: 147.34836448884985

thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry: 291.1006880894431

why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case: 92.72480709187406

no indeed i felt nothing but surprise: 141.72862726035459

lady catherine rose also and they turned back: 213.13602606460668

hill in great astonishment do not you know there is an express come for master from mr: 318.1948902781304

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command: 217.26138162601058

bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr: 211.01502737795303

a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away: 69.68430312264782

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again: 319.4663750375837

darcy appeared: 48.22846751991362

collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs: 159.93963116534226

and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart: 193.14066289439901

miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful: 366.4534164723367

hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr: 381.62307683310326

but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend: 167.9671364040602

to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit: 151.21681881212882

i dare say mr: 6.571143339712302

chapter iii: 7.526660462159987

he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you: 303.882066396167

i wish it may: 12.508446094839238

i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country: 139.07292963501556

their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them: 312.29709431876665

but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general: 123.59779237809077

my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain: 124.79022846852556

i did not wink at you: 78.31238996828067

he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party: 241.0601038860063

bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford: 113.76916653872516

and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too: 48.36682666196921

darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again: 386.88424881807083

will you tell me how long you have loved him: 89.37738845077071

darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them: 131.75249059949337

if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy: 146.27117076602335

after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation: 369.28714276586794

but it is returned she for mrs: 51.704548236502916

eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress: 321.73379207032104

i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together: 245.7841182143311

not that i care about it though: 71.3359765025031

what is your own opinion: 79.82941485618181

darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance: 280.34343249747076

he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle: 153.35005364973534

if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg tm work: 75.23374470391468

the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you: 178.35030514801576

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained: 378.98267616547395

perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me: 427.1338647312043

elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes: 238.93963210328246

had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable: 370.98822732179315

bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton: 115.34755191530434

you quite mistook mr: 163.22718016158996

i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places: 385.4216634998211

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case: 117.44024768024089

i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity: 76.43519167292

gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil: 382.0335171315412

with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return: 272.2287618841081

you have insulted me in every possible method: 110.93402111067958

an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for _us_: 171.302286296581

certainly not: 48.53591426336816

bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived: 250.79770946564275

jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay: 144.9108608636366

but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are: 163.9190575296378

i must beg to return to the house: 55.200975050064535

but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr: 271.7902612088158

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first: 111.21113038911102

he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr: 618.064993436766

and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry: 265.4511546469938

lydia was exceedingly fond of him: 101.84447133403084

i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies: 115.35523346562123

in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels: 572.1103896587907

collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known: 563.7230385470773

forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him: 139.40084162334466

you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine: 120.22050310845933

collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs: 300.43382326851025

her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr: 133.15720631183842

bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way: 91.58900646566605

it _is_ wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend: 410.23727864929947

she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks: 570.0174897718688

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved: 229.29649765273592

but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you: 105.87492861130708

good heavens: 134.10001511348545

i _should_ say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several: 203.5440135115774

one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me: 66.80969625984339

i was ready to die of laughter: 94.51454398322394

his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit: 566.7780118398593

not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months: 209.557204334699

it is every way horrible: 99.47150967560624

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire: 239.61374741081823

had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself: 280.05501581503313

kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed: 405.1314487176853

the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_: 186.54116218119117

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion: 319.25864584051607

wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr: 73.72310265432073

and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into: 299.08972487573334

what will wickham say: 116.36036231225133

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place: 291.1751917103379

when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do: 277.2165926577624

he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride: 272.8718414087223

and so extremely accomplished for her age: 213.46696316910212

wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition: 609.2840042945629

my temper i dare not vouch for: 199.27540774245438

he was my godfather and excessively attached to me: 95.62390520070393

every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch: 297.4672885518138

her performance was pleasing though by no means capital: 139.8631446850709

so much the better: 10.503174378574249

but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain: 373.7306488234602

darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it: 445.9888787443829

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth: 403.3285747613076

i know not what to think: 9.73647382537315

change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything: 640.7005858470529

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away: 582.8217434379567

lord: 14.299098800746401

sometimes: 117.37253697916539

no governess: 92.07305747251615

i: 7.015429825494975

in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house: 144.15242356676558

our distress my dear lizzy is very great: 207.0922341605776

and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr: 297.9518344002215

these causes must be stated though briefly: 419.7223062501545

you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works reports performances and research: 499.2376585228505

they may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks: 301.06422219718337

she longed to see mrs: 63.34181943634271

i do not believe a word of it my dear: 28.395502555351815

gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness: 113.48483324942458

but i knew i should persuade you at last: 95.63390351661221

it was a rational scheme to be sure: 65.5917672045124

wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement: 328.5572855457138

are you indeed: 64.84665288278617

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party: 162.45056490684325

fitzwilliam darcy: 56.28051480598635

when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed: 76.96184202789468

jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante: 362.0264156756588

i will go directly to mr: 49.40031781438047

kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry: 581.5105177689076

it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome: 190.80669677596552

his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by: 488.1209496376126

bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country: 208.2285572054228

you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt: 472.5830945350858

she smiled but made no answer: 61.14834158835622

this is not to be borne: 31.834284431718153

laws alone swamp our small staff: 1000.0

but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well: 301.6062694148561

i was never more annoyed: 41.97420618481812

she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak: 81.39452268647119

instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt: 189.52815036490162

it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon: 195.1250709062567

at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular: 412.4481391844813

yes said elizabeth drily mr: 248.03436058025935

you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all: 166.20675908193994

again she read on: 161.96649098717742

there can be no occasion for your going so soon: 35.205684085684446

he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings: 329.24980584459973

some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it: 51.52287749870327

and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report: 204.8112552098195

wickham is by no means a respectable young man: 71.51875323989579

he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay: 316.14945598924754

be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business: 416.81537853390944

what does mr: 93.71430524479695

at that moment she cared for no other: 95.62249301767683

wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration: 211.82868825845185

collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday: 135.09039312541788

could he expect that her friends would not step forward: 247.4696606917698

do not copy display perform distribute or redistribute this electronic work or any part of this electronic work without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 97.02819581407309

his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address: 448.33224755321015

of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with: 223.4093884385851

my real purpose was to see _you_ and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me: 410.59555217635153

i am impatient to see him: 21.89842672181322

you have: 24.922390659202602

the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions: 291.32996422732083

i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_: 142.6596389402206

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family: 154.54982004964916

four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister: 277.5190597926109

he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr: 203.54362541435032

i never met with anybody who delighted me so much: 100.2283821680804

to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed: 253.8275041253688

stay stay i will go myself: 742.7299377199686

why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him: 247.81648453732805

lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family: 237.2478933105584

i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship: 100.16918453913523

i thought i should have broke my heart: 104.154126019585

his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she _wished_ they might be happy: 329.56651108574613

some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages: 746.6393992855153

you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner: 358.95792707238553

elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required: 389.3868252908104

it is difficult indeed it is distressing: 151.11648658362924

with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn: 270.13012059486545

can there be any other opinion on the subject: 137.9457207462621

gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase: 497.7724032334231

then addressing her daughter oh: 309.0855052700947

jenkinson who lives with them: 154.20696597668552

had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure: 419.8950897955998

she is a great fool for going away if she liked him: 89.5278412522898

what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received: 269.57771168889315

are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted: 336.609719253967

elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ had she been his relation: 212.7018532024612

but i have other provocations: 59.55934610169234

elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression: 16.48127890925461

that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone: 134.61958692561794

not so hasty if you please: 241.1525547715364

the loss of her daughter made mrs: 70.00324743189142

we must not all expect jane s good fortune: 184.74985915734933

darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet: 211.25671043924808

bingley did not do justice to his own disposition: 40.76225426878673

it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr: 226.67130767098905

i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music: 169.5189011236924

no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village: 456.32474394944455

wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane s: 263.7718773268791

bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements: 370.30441681966767

she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr: 359.27614997586625

daughters are never of so much consequence to a father: 701.0175572050891

let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility: 178.34163483778903

when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous: 153.8440578515956

you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr: 168.86388471575515

jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected: 146.69006183885054

but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood: 114.01202885284958

some time or other he _will_ be but it shall not be by _me_: 203.31186378268026

it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night: 97.11087561827296

_hunsford near westerham kent 15th october: 1000.0

gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing: 108.97235457564565

yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word: 338.40202882767

how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr: 158.4245901143813

console lady catherine as well as you can: 147.72112025032123

elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s: 162.78551079396254

bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs: 151.7299361901442

his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her: 222.56968765643614

no no i feel he may defy us there: 314.2131344067967

i could hardly keep my countenance: 73.30446729091553

chapter vi: 7.526837439137147

darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent: 248.45633362420384

darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes: 306.5137335034703

there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well: 190.3912803507053

he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information: 394.8389698924313

did he know of their intending to go off: 326.3379318816515

wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice: 394.59217367683937

miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr: 114.89103022062342

your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it: 413.30323619451707

she does not yet leave her dressing room: 55.6585836782734

we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton: 115.6381136246109

what is it about: 59.124809733856466

and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply: 256.36823726166125

darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage: 199.51164992343905

bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well: 166.58424920287254

bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other: 222.87426276011956

i honour your circumspection: 134.84357724972554

wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her: 305.0523662219368

he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex: 229.87956792087022

egerton military library whitehall: 5.042727974736748

i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong: 399.75744381064396

it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr: 143.4730113498245

said mrs: 21.038724483342744

he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr: 316.01996709816507

i know your disposition lizzy: 120.14503556356458

it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return: 194.75440424511868

it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked: 320.1848325719611

but lizzy: 38.435981340688876

bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way: 287.12668713837655

charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say: 155.41716170093545

is miss darcy much grown since the spring: 246.10400879733731

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer: 266.69321476669245

darcy was fixed in astonishment: 119.01764716592068

she could think only of her letter: 40.52021308448398

bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character: 246.53018612980784

to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement: 363.61065079228285

bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described: 100.06609244794069

i mend pens remarkably well: 179.53132140768437

jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr: 295.31513971029216

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party: 112.0596680358278

i always had a value for him: 102.92546998462025

gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions: 447.004090176675

said elizabeth: 10.878556367058426

i am said he with a firm voice: 87.87802161257798

her performance on the piano forte is exquisite: 170.98878280921397

pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see: 535.6967578643772

darcy only can answer: 116.80722574458869

if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject: 127.33803795829186

miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere: 157.9794936673068

is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year: 103.60651347499153

jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart: 382.3942956478401

if it be not so let mr: 66.75664073149315

they were to be off as soon as possible: 27.67949948558603

are sufficiently known: 190.17351696918402

pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves: 275.77662710412426

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs: 153.95702075910782

you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew: 265.78572910002384

forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me: 86.35364082887193

i am talking of possibilities charles: 122.38506590154337

the younger ones out before the elder are married: 121.7720421436338

allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety: 631.6758365279122

if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor: 200.09357613727386

miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much: 217.27685646220516

if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers: 244.59318458422962

indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother: 293.35068093887344

but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again: 170.7825184555736

do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain: 242.37690821640504

forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public: 381.6971759006253

on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married: 323.77426320891993

gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder: 285.6606980294072

she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her: 223.71662446230505

i shall now know how to act: 114.58669031017523

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way: 307.5497337716822

but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable: 237.1849167643672

these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber: 447.8440174960011

another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment: 409.77003905060144

bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase: 458.4511195068652

to put me on my guard: 299.44661046701094

she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza: 283.44443673021254

but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was: 87.71459366422714
