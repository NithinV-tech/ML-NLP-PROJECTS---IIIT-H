i enquired after their brother of course: 640.4455242027557

we had better not mention it: 98.11092605611026

can i speak plainer: 138.08273708469633

mrs: 9.999999999999998

and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house: 557.1939321619117

mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance: 368.7659768917994

_that_ abominable mr: 251.188643150958

though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness: 338.6160238483562

contact the foundation as set forth in section <NUM> below: 453.4924338729896

i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself: 373.88623615531395

if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 129.8908251743355

she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr: 165.42112509134515

a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little: 818.6416792773615

you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this: 338.3109261562123

your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with: 272.25296311570736

but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice: 301.4335073405651

she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr: 404.98368327584154

he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia: 727.1240996543881

upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person: 397.53659318202307

his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart: 250.21089421199227

he is indeed: 46.100544018298876

she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false: 226.2652296210383

i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent: 217.4099853787135

darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine: 536.4246563075008

no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting: 477.4874332490879

merely to the illustration of _your_ character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity: 1000.0

bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage: 363.9009447200242

as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr: 319.7734784637386

he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments: 358.63328818895366

my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what i have to tell you: 437.61703907988914

people _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true: 305.34418549431916

what advantage can it be to you to offend mr: 515.2275858834412

could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections: 259.30454520094634

and what am i to do on the occasion: 88.7983357592077

as soon as ever mr: 20.418674945558863

if he wants our society let him seek it: 463.2425627438585

darcy in a most infamous manner: 202.66403883614333

gardiner: 140.57924165478985

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away: 419.5329947870638

when first mr: 416.5722949487821

i pity though i cannot help blaming her: 222.80227976733903

pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen: 79.8338914514456

such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret: 501.6451366785203

charlotte says she hardly ever does: 421.69650342858205

darcy were by no means over: 146.15005435978756

dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations: 371.59485610634704

collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty: 559.7257779644816

gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send: 179.35930630694506

i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare: 370.13095278240866

on being made acquainted with the present mr: 191.69049542307934

kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs: 121.5582567428371

she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her: 354.0239893132288

girls can i do any thing for you in meryton: 529.750580500921

mr: 9.999999999999998

in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr: 412.1717497790882

you may have drawn him in: 236.5917099507161

you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it: 242.90049466574504

darcy and herself: 19.92423406500774

bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before: 403.742058964397

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr: 115.54361117812489

elizabeth could not but look surprised: 104.7981557560573

my temper would perhaps be called resentful: 731.7703443091914

he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity: 121.0120330778031

darcy is engaged to _my daughter_: 162.72856950992687

darcy for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved: 419.8435847353218

ring the bell kitty for hill: 537.1610824328329

though mr: 177.82794100389233

jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news: 345.35615142678023

darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection: 335.8222858916266

gardiner soon wrote again to his brother: 107.18063000973802

but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation: 393.23006848504497

she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting: 89.64238032712237

but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her: 167.2203330182314

from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr: 246.69468311855874

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza: 443.99888366763514

bingley: 59.97947896754683

but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr: 473.47392673611006

what are you telling miss bennet: 204.99308910245688

but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments: 294.65366283144226

what do you think: 44.734993103017736

she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham: 581.0230858423049

bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth: 352.44995453764614

this is wholly unexpected: 95.43181693466272

their reception from mr: 52.524856845388555

but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise: 746.0234426139543

he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty: 79.49525896671692

miss elizabeth bennet: 455.59322758402914

you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it: 280.9646466935808

they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street: 261.95837487740107

darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all: 116.81095059969041

though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it: 161.1314466976673

bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery: 470.4382740132342

what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here: 170.83953777706444

his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter: 583.4053174728627

he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all: 416.0861738332148

she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way: 225.90245353812952

and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself: 138.35873612914966

when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful: 444.22511891567694

after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr: 142.21584810490026

with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs: 660.9630957035707

every thing that is charming: 37.217282113533024

there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs: 184.66762354633906

you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan: 219.9680405230783

as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister: 100.47764027345431

do you think it incredible that mr: 183.31719111061767

good or bad: 111.41265556615707

i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am _not_ a great reader and i have pleasure in many things: 229.12274874995467

said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest I am the tallest: 537.4104243945611

but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground: 321.1961740497723

if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think: 233.0597961744105

another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with _him_ if i were you: 126.60459457425672

oh: 44.50850046302919

e: 12.477362914758027

she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits: 95.63143389602634

_you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it: 91.99040927575709

my dear you flatter me: 235.734234702073

james s: 752.4908836028416

miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before: 161.02811362601526

both changed colour one looked white the other red: 830.3145559310216

your mother must have been quite a slave to your education: 435.25577888160853

wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight: 121.38158401299276

jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr: 203.93316412336335

it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind: 440.69000989944016

but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled: 486.5085675867325

but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure: 208.0286775047136

and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books: 295.8566811462254

she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper: 536.0701526384173

young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way: 343.8271972091748

my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me: 250.21696841409758

bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match: 187.76510059364196

at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr: 198.02362187987293

my motive for cautioning you is as follows: 279.3216438475156

come here child cried her father as she appeared: 1042.1358948515835

in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was: 355.7956684705085

his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue: 291.2578712473119

yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished: 206.75068649077696

no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you: 323.2721068705311

darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr: 223.75698670404188

_i_ talked about the dance and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples: 384.53740002638074

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy: 233.6605966798052

no not at all: 105.91548918626852

gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it: 420.11765472469995

their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency: 158.62754594749015

she is not such a simpleton: 86.5937645014073

i beg your pardon: 41.016660855861936

what is the matter: 47.996106879315136

they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit: 440.1387214527977

but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves: 233.05542525030688

if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it: 223.69762425782045

elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement: 286.82448633836754

mary and kitty thank heaven: 108.97763675329848

so genteel and so easy: 517.8450315624405

obstinate headstrong girl: 1000.0

bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter: 542.0539668736503

she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter: 169.88646389281996

s: 255.728684110085

about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand: 434.46400248495786

but you have chosen your fault well: 174.96759020277008

bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr: 389.6228415349946

was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield: 402.14255272848953

how much of good or evil must be done by him: 71.95790150234927

pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself: 410.819138863697

philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body: 106.6879781065959

but she had no reason to fear mr: 116.56361790409184

you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me: 469.6917593527405

darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy: 169.9493613113377

at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer: 432.5723410221711

she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs: 770.4447168864381

hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest: 335.3382162633994

if _she_ does not object to it why should _we_: 450.72360086158164

her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable: 236.6163944304067

when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject: 288.7498384245047

nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world: 314.024742809834

but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized: 490.39240687825816

i knew how it would be: 64.73902176814673

bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own: 409.9059969670115

elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce: 144.78491079972545

i wish you had been there: 102.82738823217105

gardiner left them soon after breakfast: 303.1292096710495

the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again: 378.1357588547054

and if i am that choice why may not i accept him: 245.84258424359786

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs: 125.24062054770297

i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either: 264.17553585528026

i am astonished my dear said mrs: 81.20306999324407

he heard her with astonishment: 35.376909326132356

elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes: 597.0352084968271

there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects: 591.7039562007367

good gracious: 19.255615416261072

how are they even to be discovered: 253.48987651033033

but before they heard again from mr: 193.5161432900937

there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much: 219.1852483662003

we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply: 271.43327818272064

bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene: 348.3187425081488

elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere: 296.09055978765304

bennet were dead: 493.6880215612706

elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship: 515.5172005461224

yes: 244.45210042333377

d: 1000.0

bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it: 619.3523416564389

the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her: 529.8070941825006

yes indeed cried mrs: 533.2835701044157

and so did mrs: 102.1711008645475

she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so: 203.14242238562875

as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes: 454.41614466184234

i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together: 150.62189292655992

jane now came up: 761.3781624402399

and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule: 406.48633972697877

<NUM>: 288.69897984680244

promise me therefore to come to hunsford: 315.8842916236874

vol: 255.728684110085

yes my youngest is not sixteen: 761.4020104738049

as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth: 237.3600367659866

bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters: 46.62449729539614

are you quite sure madam: 33.570146381244925

bennet s ill humour or ill health: 406.57939589645207

her report was highly favourable: 696.5158003314851

elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation: 420.58017869877494

there was also a postscript to this effect: 152.95555919219055

i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox: 186.0310345345121

collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter: 372.7549482313006

one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad: 593.8149431545131

stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all: 843.2812236075023

i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes: 51.330536329324715

the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them: 205.5658417634412

and you only the second: 283.4697604292785

believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire: 329.47604740217025

collins in describing the civility of mr: 85.2351205300488

collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character: 403.96169473583404

f: 20.28726455136329

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless: 230.62327208800062

collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings: 252.4041671474995

miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be: 261.53420164019593

i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior: 411.601073575788

i have already told her so once by your desire: 392.57217556252334

because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it: 369.97064309847053

well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr: 455.54182652785613

the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience: 410.1061905812199

bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him: 208.16546393685968

and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice: 744.4762037861285

a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago: 627.7426329710814

with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms: 152.1768033285147

wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr: 171.48930691304625

susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough: 830.3145559310216

bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity: 299.44434965415996

will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again: 182.12136526447387

pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p: 288.3191761585099

their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge: 560.7876887751935

my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect: 450.6250894669873

by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song: 356.93286742705214

who should suffer but myself: 278.30702350007675

but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed: 132.70841093053374

collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless: 532.0500770185628

it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled: 165.04289160027136

collins by jane s introduction of him: 185.87846651589066

yet now i must believe you cried jane: 352.0148143981008

gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance: 423.14831992603604

but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object: 88.19535618618755

in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her: 493.76675793193726

you forget that i have made no answer: 38.61622285942677

certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it: 559.4158647917244

the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions: 675.3537366631244

at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here: 321.8124160347978

but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion: 400.87111950530766

they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance: 249.53298831045376

people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking: 592.637239435057

morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week: 210.8622015714811

chapter xiii: 48.48959581755913

when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr: 281.27824523135524

their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs: 574.8147034308222

miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with: 167.4929192477104

having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs: 594.5712216508482

in a few days mr: 68.74189426223595

no no you shall not deceive me: 232.9124552034963

they were not the only objects of mr: 79.19169485166968

you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say: 76.7026718970643

denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here: 312.2642794198136

the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever: 176.93173895847005

there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law: 326.941592137222

ah: 24.254486605561237

very very much: 82.30716175208069

with _your_ good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others: 180.90657052934662

it was lady catherine de bourgh: 12.18556102067344

bingley is not he: 308.1500329294645

no lizzy that is what i do _not_ choose: 137.28067461548315

elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing: 203.2083483657

london printed for t: 15.874385962908006

lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth: 543.6497928275691

their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago: 333.2993246253888

it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world: 172.4452838559574

i wish i could call her amiable: 199.92093850345057

darcy: 176.21040104283324

they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something: 196.93394047246852

all loveliness and goodness as she is: 289.8760602855791

younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement: 459.06214250955736

i know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder: 164.1582323987016

perhaps i do: 128.3756430900296

one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding i believe: 149.31977355793185

but my father cannot: 132.32570368036443

about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon: 467.9864791412487

i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did: 139.97464665716268

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs: 386.7781718980876

we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode: 662.6356911530202

happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance: 640.5651868138426

darcy with him and sat down again by her sister: 44.400125157185926

and is this all: 229.75123758565792

it will not do: 251.13091374761615

she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence: 350.8394261369944

the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street: 412.6278549042101

now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence: 400.7646304412261

bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card: 413.6895866885245

their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget: 715.1149077871213

and mrs: 14.04719970780085

only think what an establishment it would be for one of them: 103.98238685117875

long and the gouldings soon: 183.22157728074748

i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion: 311.05361363290956

gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive: 215.07011718264854

miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it: 134.96125989243853

respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown: 769.7679173158333

she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration: 400.7997886997323

i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn: 133.90615656965235

bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family: 179.06597904353967

at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage: 297.48484713089294

my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction: 264.0782001290218

_my_ affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever: 503.19387413904366

she answered him with cold civility: 88.85185850248838

darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel: 295.2454154454327

transcriber s note spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book: 797.8113514400237

gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated: 524.7829700172786

your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you: 290.3943674216978

his manners are very different from his cousin s: 173.33797558973433

as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner: 253.60827822010586

with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed: 559.0251236872723

reynolds could interest her on no other point: 501.1872336272726

collins has made you an offer of marriage: 48.21249306107445

when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument: 504.5224489004789

and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission: 564.5375182881487

i who have prided myself on my discernment: 639.9074776246354

the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres: 372.47592527831563

which do you mean: 334.92345694376684

darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former: 268.17394047504933

his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother: 274.38464923182136

your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds: 543.3551758992295

when i went away i felt that it would soon happen: 161.48943075995595

pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned: 463.8522637814596

engaged to mr: 261.967074433916

it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of _some_ conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible: 157.3233626871227

what is it you mean: 79.52144264470455

i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy: 256.61228198748984

no thanks to his gallantry for that: 641.050030687515

dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered: 130.14931556913314

hurst had a house: 340.0024199474566

your mother insists upon your accepting it: 647.9177826689961

when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence: 457.653677388286

my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cannot think: 233.26534766720113

darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began: 447.8153317819969

darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for: 324.8190230465238

that such a consequence as _this_ should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts: 705.9550462407159

before any answer could arrive from mr: 295.47393848048216

and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters: 75.37887652144991

on both sides it was only assertion: 242.2189522001802

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way: 126.30358845098051

i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power: 135.73315544293024

he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks: 423.6544753037311

wickham for the last time: 259.07836702013793

elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made: 312.87155111729777

but it is of small importance: 45.95004673508564

i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible: 218.3683490065983

and what sort of table do they keep: 147.81647146511887

there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake: 502.44671180630024

see paragraph <NUM>: 22.93092166546913

the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand: 239.62365010453766

well cried elizabeth have it as you choose: 315.1497359433122

yet how just a humiliation: 457.8064104531869

philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could: 426.5743433013056

i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object: 192.53613930158534

pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before: 418.9229156169722

their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme: 535.9100662635433

darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr: 215.52376978975602

to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point: 454.46235615121884

chapter x: 209.4425832607595

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk: 145.65705530294323

i know how much you dislike him: 93.63261792833651

the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense: 421.9222287200741

at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr: 177.84045302129272

darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise: 265.8419687068444

you must contrive to send somebody: 327.994027891071

he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded: 545.8054591111354

colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr: 119.60391751895843

have all her friends left her: 271.14473521448303

she complained bitterly of all this to her husband: 110.86848201356715

you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage: 426.6820265717248

if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry: 518.0409263515558

bennet: 30.838102667359063

you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these: 327.5026669919736

in this danger kitty is also comprehended: 408.49236687340795

his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend: 301.0000741661403

the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity: 397.23078768831607

_i_ never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united: 199.51804568498517

she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over: 259.9723466346944

he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long: 356.68014773306277

his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it: 178.80519913174066

but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride: 356.5962778310427

i expected you to stay two months: 160.71524458639715

who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away: 418.8240316200387

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning: 229.79535719467935

perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation: 483.4882986085564

to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing: 361.4250628204974

lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room: 302.0538188233014

i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she: 42.63761683434856

elizabeth almost stared at her: 278.2606112794601

i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas: 689.3360442199405

i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her: 253.94784916094864

oh yes: 679.8880638719143

we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary: 221.020697732481

every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness: 87.80681724244997

but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good: 177.31583397334953

i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am: 312.9841727062442

collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement: 692.6695612394674

observed mrs: 1000.0

wickham only shook his head: 259.07836702013793

i thought i should have died: 88.27437788840241

if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr: 364.1237328486295

bingley is coming down sister for mrs: 308.0895156171077

you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite: 549.544101314806

how can it affect them: 264.23852314539204

that that is the worst of all: 196.13710784618385

i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other: 222.9056433622409

darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him: 386.54870527869963

miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs: 364.00215546549356

he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man: 144.19038769264745

let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance: 388.65732960968614

have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity: 297.3185292550692

they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved: 386.04386254754525

of mr: 16.220295232656394

my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me: 562.5048809244838

but you _will_ know it when i have told you what happened the very next day: 191.80870089325043

is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w: 306.4368092228208

she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery: 534.3486632997367

said elizabeth to herself: 56.490078832820636

my dear jane mr: 506.39537406325786

you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy: 229.80644488008667

sir william only smiled: 151.6822356120015

for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line: 321.6301790933592

but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone: 503.60889732365285

they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day: 288.1427271478117

my aunt told me so herself on saturday: 159.8907730272207

darcy is: 91.77376160487043

she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained: 394.8505092975107

it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations: 168.08131136442032

and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley: 187.6895979994193

i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood: 106.70187349111288

in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better: 474.7885367268069

the business was therefore soon settled: 181.4465329521771

the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent: 485.0234717464553

long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided: 210.3954554488482

you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age: 286.84751557126026

she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions: 133.25043972403586

ten thousand pounds: 121.36717602890289

i who have valued myself on my abilities: 639.9074776246354

bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on: 675.1254657814998

_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr: 213.02454346249962

but my dear you must indeed go and see mr: 162.87413697870406

elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma: 232.4410009675293

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield: 426.1671826801927

bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon: 725.5381748520623

i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london: 118.55823623626618

you look pale: 515.5258392935506

this is your final resolve: 133.4907914167465

the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation: 66.43770704788753

chapter xi: 209.4425832607595

and his answering immediately to the last question oh: 236.8919159413262

i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to: 500.3813579280993

far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter: 264.96913980339633

but you do not know _all_: 52.36567480586008

bennet exceedingly: 413.82406024123054

his character was decided: 51.13900342976866

bennet give up the point: 221.65687467277291

he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please: 315.3798372995772

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home: 191.80570439208046

i am afraid mr: 61.12712493885902

but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks: 355.05870013377336

but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me: 161.02335748141124

is nothing due to me on that score: 501.1872336272726

from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr: 167.71414822577412

there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself: 268.6442219311576

elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom: 405.0033717657041

on their being joined by mr: 113.69741462064631

when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication: 258.55659384072425

how shall i bear so much happiness: 440.4206718813607

lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living: 232.43137879993105

i should never have said mrs: 38.2269254368936

if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed: 375.8168184656491

elizabeth shook her head over this letter: 369.74891211790356

hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward: 472.6308712149691

good heaven: 80.2220322626064

he is come mr: 33.61716577177894

and may i ask: 100.32224600016559

always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body: 433.91393399500276

in the evening soon after mr: 101.01644216249797

he cannot afford it: 243.45668750148715

she declared her resolution: 526.9206586607528

this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for: 335.4122148920612

bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield: 441.04709895539594

darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter: 129.53442968724946

i admire all my three sons in law highly said he: 413.4630637638254

she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay: 258.0367189602574

arguments are too much like disputes: 537.1610824328329

no no this is not likely: 163.65395820666708

she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle: 309.6801636664038

how he lived i know not: 167.62977303969774

their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr: 601.8574030118592

miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose: 301.76869178172785

what a fine thing for our girls: 418.10564163401693

they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas: 436.782265370837

i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals: 434.858454360583

i need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable: 448.93407779302674

darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr: 163.72626134553244

i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that _you_ that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr: 611.973391445354

she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country: 214.3448225717688

were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express: 222.0433758219098

depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all: 207.65176397039534

remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin: 318.8389068780344

it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family: 108.3444022790941

well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better: 278.40175195343755

collins was also in the same state of angry pride: 288.73944023499536

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family: 225.48217923341304

bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her: 256.843192772577

they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream: 442.06039975141834

philips: 217.94577217528945

we are not in a way to know _what_ mr: 69.61308997548359

i told mrs: 56.86446603047543

in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference: 207.65990243438054

she cried: 27.858904507225276

he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump: 498.1233088160494

i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with: 218.12056492532855

the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs: 537.5520669043392

lizzy you must not do so: 41.619196115781

she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two: 227.6397199906398

this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled: 817.4927200414929

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained: 606.396764566684

undoubtedly: 190.668422808014

and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications: 129.90721635762478

bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time: 149.3323997398216

denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr: 526.1500812213537

wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr: 120.91780871120613

bingley will dance with you at the next ball: 98.35171358984222

it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance: 269.7240629069987

he begged pardon for having displeased her: 389.8951256233786

said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate: 293.63950030543566

he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it: 352.47285354061154

my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them: 170.78757203560582

he replied and was again silent: 346.5902022545169

your humility mr: 689.2900132566867

jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better: 498.6965117724641

i speak nothing but the truth: 127.88340987633107

the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but mr: 201.01672692662896

when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal: 494.90600612990966

accompanied by a violent yawn: 1000.0

his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father: 422.1488210790071

her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it: 234.58434756921318

collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair: 381.69150518854684

cried jane what do you mean sir: 144.24255033602606

bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces: 278.0887433561849

forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton: 388.884679519993

pray read on: 123.91442955572934

aye there she comes continued mrs: 419.7427730453502

let me congratulate you on a very important conquest: 352.22672458138373

the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies: 335.3546735826699

do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place: 129.37892620348052

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day: 116.56351755057604

you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence: 216.30849926891315

thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry: 430.302053123175

why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case: 99.82372274437823

no indeed i felt nothing but surprise: 368.9647273407173

lady catherine rose also and they turned back: 733.4297217678425

hill in great astonishment do not you know there is an express come for master from mr: 299.78451661149865

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command: 199.85184067215621

bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr: 230.88670085578315

a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away: 145.14914542853813

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again: 327.7116796070406

darcy appeared: 114.21385853631135

collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs: 162.39174998012822

and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart: 201.87733042327628

miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful: 629.5425134518892

hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr: 489.5001185911557

but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend: 227.21751274544033

to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit: 222.10325289289804

i dare say mr: 50.327752960610965

chapter iii: 209.4425832607595

he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you: 312.9797016092666

i wish it may: 42.67184821585022

i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country: 209.45062515653595

their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them: 252.76059583747715

but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general: 164.67694108721898

my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain: 218.2879468293728

i did not wink at you: 110.58406087410468

he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party: 228.7267992988558

bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford: 170.96446717647308

and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too: 74.01090367802794

darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again: 489.9521506287426

will you tell me how long you have loved him: 200.41773721324026

darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them: 195.68560226272498

if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the rules is very easy: 155.50397112880597

after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation: 435.8045116616192

but it is returned she for mrs: 75.91542599954481

eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress: 274.1503028445226

i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together: 191.816299381748

not that i care about it though: 541.0525016082731

what is your own opinion: 198.69026157371434

darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance: 592.7649973988341

he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle: 142.51538858126253

if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg tm work: 85.6445681666925

the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you: 253.97297233314313

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained: 600.1071297536929

perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me: 539.3957036418948

elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes: 195.3480590768593

had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable: 436.76186052419723

bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton: 120.91522632224827

you quite mistook mr: 575.7165289200442

i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places: 388.91714077947034

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case: 201.369860762995

i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity: 89.53988100673806

gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil: 369.8148804670357

with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return: 323.54416050189707

you have insulted me in every possible method: 224.55133297923763

an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for _us_: 265.98652436757175

certainly not: 51.31083481775825

bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived: 329.04881786991837

jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay: 288.603197193709

but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are: 286.3374572851279

i must beg to return to the house: 83.38644963342793

but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr: 551.6949750226196

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first: 89.81041155841324

he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr: 858.6432882927955

and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already _make_ them marry: 276.20836792232166

lydia was exceedingly fond of him: 104.72988684477767

i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies: 226.51556616383237

in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels: 871.3499935337715

collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known: 595.1177338064205

forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him: 120.84833565999062

you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine: 135.6159369780857

collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs: 355.15512735346516

her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr: 204.2225058036604

bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way: 123.67537070941229

it _is_ wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend: 581.2754631076946

she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks: 646.4880164380571

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved: 217.49678252628027

but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you: 416.62719263980483

good heavens: 223.07919920532615

i _should_ say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several: 224.3238953851082

one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me: 62.003559499653484

i was ready to die of laughter: 152.06875763550715

his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit: 677.3156070751348

not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months: 211.15018326589907

it is every way horrible: 258.5221395773683

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire: 252.80235473026406

had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself: 333.9607090493278

kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed: 522.2405403505709

the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_: 286.02417816109187

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion: 392.0671268217887

wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr: 98.01233594414384

and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into: 276.7610556231239

what will wickham say: 265.4594652552781

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place: 356.1042678863661

when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do: 398.5291097965014

he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride: 223.79100187805838

and so extremely accomplished for her age: 379.716198069558

wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition: 678.44370009245

my temper i dare not vouch for: 583.0037916891231

he was my godfather and excessively attached to me: 157.55871740639734

every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch: 287.6243157974209

her performance was pleasing though by no means capital: 274.7819243158832

so much the better: 38.57962534830043

but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain: 384.98433261324806

darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it: 507.1610280876547

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth: 419.1830635511779

i know not what to think: 15.13076218122118

change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything: 507.6549081485896

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away: 608.425334187265

lord: 29.694417975041187

sometimes: 505.6962369941908

no governess: 613.1822017054228

i: 43.05293114575724

in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house: 152.0893171039766

our distress my dear lizzy is very great: 176.42533102400182

and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr: 514.661215301725

these causes must be stated though briefly: 464.15888336127796

you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works reports performances and research: 636.5391152363219

they may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks: 461.13115606773226

she longed to see mrs: 129.2432944650744

i do not believe a word of it my dear: 45.571739426318445

gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness: 121.64610715656747

but i knew i should persuade you at last: 256.5429335263008

it was a rational scheme to be sure: 78.96836292100393

wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement: 386.8629221745876

are you indeed: 63.09573444801932

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party: 165.00691074030274

fitzwilliam darcy: 83.2565021995913

when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed: 177.54240127343112

jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante: 384.59434320269844

i will go directly to mr: 104.48421284462691

kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry: 677.2084200470889

it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome: 222.2568223894321

his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by: 515.3396773579306

bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country: 281.58000797532543

you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt: 639.611791574281

she smiled but made no answer: 109.97878552025121

this is not to be borne: 43.0289323162193

laws alone swamp our small staff: 1000.0

but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well: 380.98716102440653

i was never more annoyed: 72.29308579795892

she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak: 122.83071953203662

instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt: 254.90460823774663

it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon: 236.79287480013988

at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular: 591.8370965242572

yes said elizabeth drily mr: 732.3214184225038

you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i tell you all: 264.2813287277312

again she read on: 190.66842280801376

there can be no occasion for your going so soon: 137.4731398113334

he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings: 561.3734354205886

some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it: 46.795180612633025

and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report: 404.20470104990216

wickham is by no means a respectable young man: 192.33188580854883

he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay: 358.5246696061233

be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business: 407.4836080464065

what does mr: 229.89392592135962

at that moment she cared for no other: 238.78612316581595

wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration: 308.92965548873303

collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday: 168.16119557142446

could he expect that her friends would not step forward: 233.4364684314575

do not copy display perform distribute or redistribute this electronic work or any part of this electronic work without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph <NUM>: 201.16361015003287

his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address: 430.7730513371217

of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with: 280.7110478074934

my real purpose was to see _you_ and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me: 480.31855152808

i am impatient to see him: 39.72959118536389

you have: 138.0901564280137

the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions: 336.02338503434055

i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_: 158.3567289049577

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family: 316.44076465693917

four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister: 322.92843512793655

he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr: 262.73801226796365

i never met with anybody who delighted me so much: 101.08779016653958

to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed: 399.28128368317266

stay stay i will go myself: 537.1610824328329

why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him: 332.9687210523344

lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family: 251.27075324220485

i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship: 295.8762574624274

i thought i should have broke my heart: 143.43915972948275

his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she _wished_ they might be happy: 377.8990870488907

some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages: 911.2159765560624

you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner: 394.24599407318465

elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required: 470.65386309884246

it is difficult indeed it is distressing: 200.97716868826922

with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn: 233.57109743226476

can there be any other opinion on the subject: 96.72318183383203

gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase: 621.8571187489334

then addressing her daughter oh: 372.7593720314937

jenkinson who lives with them: 230.84526370246863

had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure: 386.4477365446697

she is a great fool for going away if she liked him: 152.4567988166606

what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received: 288.32485660254383

are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted: 339.61363656193856

elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_ had she been his relation: 302.6308819676095

but i have other provocations: 488.0239542971355

elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression: 37.17479282251304

that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone: 155.23302185902324

not so hasty if you please: 644.8466756816428

the loss of her daughter made mrs: 95.16611835582603

we must not all expect jane s good fortune: 187.87637302184226

darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet: 562.5625347108396

bingley did not do justice to his own disposition: 86.29638435814594

it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr: 215.87738092115185

i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music: 240.54999605096967

no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village: 680.5250842968484

wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well as jane s: 369.9913213780546

bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements: 511.4735850925539

she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _she_ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr: 431.67778028882367

daughters are never of so much consequence to a father: 660.7994814902931

let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility: 222.09878629220782

when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous: 243.16325047207698

you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr: 324.61586708716015

jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected: 176.9723764481439

but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood: 187.72648984181902

some time or other he _will_ be but it shall not be by _me_: 324.33232753967525

it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night: 242.69494692824722

_hunsford near westerham kent 15th october: 1000.0

gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing: 182.2209362846736

yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word: 703.1507483479587

how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr: 297.8688871690552

console lady catherine as well as you can: 106.14170935685371

elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s: 280.47933005117653

bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs: 198.980125816932

his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her: 306.1634112690315

no no i feel he may defy us there: 504.08550366993757

i could hardly keep my countenance: 82.22503712035879

chapter vi: 209.4425832607595

darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent: 228.08279222040557

darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes: 509.9647096658424

there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well: 309.4298524241702

he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information: 480.0235330611151

did he know of their intending to go off: 374.0065713120043

wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice: 688.9261628329729

miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr: 269.80015050719373

your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it: 453.9391330285875

she does not yet leave her dressing room: 263.5913718518827

we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton: 319.1733803877485

what is it about: 167.93738146650279

and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply: 376.20651906455925

darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage: 248.77950829429943

bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well: 270.5429859784473

bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other: 473.0100351271569

i honour your circumspection: 475.18418186079464

wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her: 413.25094956200405

he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex: 222.54005081839034

egerton military library whitehall: 181.85460582493442

i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong: 491.27338961069637

it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr: 425.8002550653503

said mrs: 54.913334381127534

he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr: 325.0368196626125

i know your disposition lizzy: 196.9940557503482

it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return: 235.04460818555643

it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked: 327.6532403675476

but lizzy: 95.6626869767032

bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way: 403.8325745363244

charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say: 204.7231317695832

is miss darcy much grown since the spring: 408.47634982225753

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer: 367.05785514755627

darcy was fixed in astonishment: 255.42754723852002

she could think only of her letter: 104.03385417538819

bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character: 347.0376006060355

to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement: 350.04603282437796

bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described: 142.25232661277215

i mend pens remarkably well: 528.4751250565588

jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr: 531.0376673676351

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party: 143.25942666451954

i always had a value for him: 129.6077035093044

gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions: 591.9035352096083

said elizabeth: 13.426359489640099

i am said he with a firm voice: 138.00907538196452

her performance on the piano forte is exquisite: 289.3043597980589

pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see: 493.8380859014373

darcy only can answer: 383.3698983766244

if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject: 99.59350189135847

miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere: 166.06257289782775

is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year: 47.88276401479105

jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart: 505.90321146763927

if it be not so let mr: 198.90238486304932

they were to be off as soon as possible: 33.80402385369222

are sufficiently known: 251.188643150958

pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves: 296.5806149182876

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs: 220.3249826294095

you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew: 354.7866029353186

forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me: 144.70607638591403

i am talking of possibilities charles: 291.5247806200664

the younger ones out before the elder are married: 239.9665889156677

allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety: 594.5121939382902

if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor: 222.27152258663884

miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much: 263.64398344382386

if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers: 301.938619559996

indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother: 461.566026374777

but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again: 169.9868248588549

do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain: 379.86913403599374

forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public: 329.437450101199

on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married: 417.545009565705

gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder: 469.2441959315878

she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her: 311.0564726149602

i shall now know how to act: 210.91965767124864

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way: 379.6147587073988

but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable: 257.2079612363683

these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber: 463.04014928378234

another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment: 397.9349837898028

bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase: 447.95035872473113

to put me on my guard: 772.5347711126013

she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza: 512.3985269885831

but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was: 102.6540605094122
